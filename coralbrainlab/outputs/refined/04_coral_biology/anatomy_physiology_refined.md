# Coral Anatomy & Physiology

## Overview
Corals are complex colonial organisms that exist as a delicate "meta-organism"—a symbiotic partnership between a host animal (the cnidarian polyp) and photosynthetic algae (zooxanthellae) living within its tissues. Understanding coral anatomy is the foundation of advanced reef-keeping because every external parameter we manage—from lighting to trace elements—interacts directly with specific biological structures. The health of a reef system is essentially the sum of the health of these microscopic tissue layers. [TIER-1: NOAA]

At its most fundamental level, a coral is a living interface. The outer tissue layers manage gas exchange and nutrient capture, while the internal layers facilitate the energetic partnership with algae and the construction of the calcium carbonate skeleton. By understanding the "why" behind coral structures—such as why a polyp extends, how it produces defensive mucus, or how it builds its skeleton—aquaculturists can move from reactive maintenance to predictive husbandry, identifying subtle changes in tissue density or behavior before they manifest as critical failures.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Tri-Layer Tissue System
The coral polyp body wall consists of three primary layers, each with distinct physiological roles:
*   **Ectoderm (Epidermis):** The outermost layer in direct contact with seawater. It contains specialized cells for defense and feeding (nematocytes), mucus-secreting cells, and sensory cells. [TIER-1: NOAA]
*   **Gastroderm (Gastrodermis):** The innermost layer lining the gastrovascular cavity. This is the "engine room" where the majority of symbiotic zooxanthellae reside, facilitating nutrient exchange and digestion. [TIER-1: AIMS]
*   **Mesoglea:** A jelly-like, non-cellular matrix between the ectoderm and gastroderm. It provides structural support, facilitates nutrient migration, and allows for the elastic expansion and contraction of the polyp. [TIER-1: NOAA]

### 2. The Polyp & Colonial Gastrovascular Network
A coral colony is a massive collection of genetically identical polyps connected by a thin layer of tissue called the **coenosarc**. [TIER-1: NOAA]
*   **Colonial Connectivity:** The central gastrovascular cavities (coelenteron) of individual polyps are interconnected via a network of canals. This allows the colony to function as a single physiological unit, sharing nutrients and energy acquired by one part of the colony with another.
*   **Mouth/Anus:** A single opening serves both for ingestion and waste expulsion.
*   **Tentacles & Nematocytes:** Specialized stinging cells (nematocytes) within the tentacles allow corals to capture prey and defend territory against competitors. [TIER-1: NOAA]

### 3. Biomineralization: The Proton Pump Mechanism
Skeletal growth occurs in a specialized region of the ectoderm called the **calicodermis**. [TIER-1: Biomineralization Research]
*   **The Proton Pump:** To build a skeleton, corals must precipitate calcium carbonate (aragonite). This process is hindered by acidity. Calicoblast cells actively "pump" hydrogen ions (protons / H+) out of the sub-calicoblastic space and into the surrounding water. 
*   **pH Manipulation:** This active transport raises the local pH at the site of calcification, creating a micro-environment where aragonite crystals can form more easily. [TIER-1: Scientific Consensus]
*   **Organic Matrix:** The coral secretes a protein-rich framework that guides the crystal growth, ensuring the skeleton follows the genetic mapping of the species.

### 4. Colony Morphologies: SPS vs. LPS
*   **Small Polyp Stony (SPS):** Minimal tissue volume over thin skeleton. Dependent on high-velocity flow to strip away boundary layers and facilitate gas exchange across high surface-area tissue. [TIER-2: BRS Investigates]
*   **Large Polyp Stony (LPS):** Higher tissue volume. Capable of significant hydrostatic expansion (inflating with water) to increase surface area for light capture or to capture larger prey. [TIER-2: Tidal Gardens]

## Practical Application

### Identifying Health via Polyp Extension
Polyp extension (PE) is the primary "dashboard" of coral health.
*   **Daytime PE:** Indicates efficient gas exchange and light capture.
*   **Nighttime PE:** Primarily for feeding.
*   **Retraction:** Occurs during stress, predation, or cleaning. Persistent retraction indicates a failure of the local micro-environment (e.g., poor flow or chemical toxicity). [TIER-2: Reef2Reef Expert Consensus]

### The Mucus Ciliary System (Slime Coat)
Corals produce a constant layer of mucus (the "slime coat") that serves three critical roles:
1.  **Defense:** Sloughing off pathogens, sediment, and toxins.
2.  **Feeding:** In some species, mucus is used to "trap" particulate matter which is then swept into the mouth by cilia.
3.  **Prevention of Desiccation:** Protecting tissue during low-tide exposure. [TIER-2: Triton Official]

### Tissue Density & Receding
"Tight" tissue, where the skeleton is visible through the skin, is a precursor to starvation or light stress. Rapid Tissue Necrosis (RTN) occurs when the bond between the calicodermis and skeleton fails due to extreme alkalinity swings (>2.0 dKH) or severe bacterial infection. [TIER-1: Triton Detox Protocols]

### Fragging Safety
When fragging (asexual propagation), cutting create open wounds in the coenosarc. Successful healing depends on the coral's ability to seal these wounds using its mesoglea and gastroderm. Stable alkalinity and trace elements like Iodine and Zinc are essential for these repair mechanisms. [TIER-2: WWC/Tidal Gardens]

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Component | Function | Maintenance Priority | Source |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Zooxanthellae** | Energy Production | High (Light/Nutrient Balance) | [TIER-1] |
| **Calicodermis** | Skeletal Growth | High (Alk/Ca/pH Stability) | [TIER-1] |
| **Nematocytes** | Defense/Feeding | Medium (Trace Element Support) | [TIER-1] |
| **Coenosarc** | Colony Communication| Medium (Flow/Pathogen Control) | [TIER-1] |
| **Mucus Layer** | Protection/Waste | Medium (Iodine Levels) | [TIER-2] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Alkalinity Stability:** Swings >2.0 dKH/day can trigger "alk burn" where the calicodermis separates from the skeleton (RTN). [TIER-1: Triton Baseline]
*   **Temperature Extremes:** Temperatures >32°C cause the expulsion of zooxanthellae (Bleaching), severing the core physiological partnership. [TIER-1: NOAA]

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Trace Element Balance:** Elements like Iodine and Manganese are critical for the metabolic health of coral tissues; deficiency leads to fading pigmentation and reduced disease resistance. [TIER-2: Triton Core7]

## Gaps / Open Questions
*   **[GAP]:** The exact mechanism of long-distance colonial signaling (how a polyp on one side of a large colony "knows" another side is being eaten) is still being researched.
*   **[VERIFY]:** The specific role of "green fluorescent proteins" (GFPs) in metabolic cooling vs. photo-protection. [CONFLICT]
