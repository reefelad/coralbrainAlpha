# Cyanobacteria Management

## Overview
Cyanobacteria, often misidentified by hobbyists as "red slime algae," are actually a phylum of photosynthetic bacteria that are among the oldest known life forms on Earth. Biologically, they are true pioneers, capable of thriving in environments where other organisms fail. Their evolutionary success lies in their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, a unique adaptation that allows them to manufacture their own nitrogen source when dissolved nitrate is scarce. In the closed ecosystem of a reef aquarium, this gives them a distinct advantage during periods of chemical imbalance.

The appearance of cyanobacteria is rarely a simple sign of "dirty water" or excess nutrients, as traditional wisdom often suggests. Instead, it is almost always a biological symptom of an ecological niche opening up—typically due to an imbalance in the ratio of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Carbon (the Redfield Ratio) or a collapse in the competitive microbiome. Understanding this biological "Why" is critical to management: you are not fighting an algae infestation, but rather a bacterial dominance event caused by a vacuum in the system's biological stability. Successful eradication requires closing that niche by restoring chemical balance and microbial diversity, rather than simply poisoning the bacteria.

## Key Concepts

### The N:C:P Ratio and "Clean Water" Myths
Cyanobacteria outbreaks are famously paradoxical, appearing in tanks with high nutrients *and* in ultra-low nutrient systems. The unifying factor is the Ratio of Nitrogen to Carbon to Phosphorus.
*   **The Zero-Nitrate Trap:** In modern reefkeeping, efficient filtration can strip nitrates to 0.00 ppm while phosphates remain detectable. This low N:P ratio creates a "limitation access" scenario. Algae and beneficial bacteria starve without nitrogen, but cyanobacteria switch to nitrogen fixation, tapping into an unlimited fuel source that their competitors cannot access.
*   **Carbon Availability:** Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) acts as a fuel source. An imbalance where DOC is high but nitrate/phosphate is low can further fuel bacterial blooms. Triton’s N-DOC testing specifically targets this relationship to diagnose outbreaks before they become visible plagues.
*   **TIER-1 SOURCE:** Triton Applied Reef Science / Redfield Ratio principles.

### Competitive Exclusion & Flow Dynamics
Cyanobacteria form mats to create their own micro-environments.
*   **The Boundary Layer:** They thrive in stagnant boundary layers where flow is insufficient to disrupt their colony structure or deliver oxygen to competitors. Increasing flow does not just "blow them away"; it disrupts the chemical micro-climate they build around themselves.
*   **Microbial Warfare:** A healthy reef tank has a diverse microbiome (bacteria, archaea, micro-fauna) that occupies every surface. Cyanobacteria typically bloom when this microbiome is compromised—after antibiotic treatments (like Cipro/flux), tank transfers, or "starting dry" with dead rock. Restoring biodiversity (e.g., adding live rock rubble, bacterial supplements) is a method of "crowding out" the invader.

### Chemical vs. Holistic Treatment
*   **Holistic (Triton Method):** Defines the outbreak as a chemistry problem. Identification involves N-DOC testing to find the missing or excess element (usually a Carbon/Nitrogen mismatch). Treatment involves correcting the ratio (e.g., dosing Nitrate, reducing Carbon) and using non-antibiotic inhibitors (like Triton CYA-NO) to weaken the bacteria while manual removal exports the bound nutrients.
*   **Chemical (Antibiotics/Oxidizers):** Products like Chemiclean use oxidizers or mild antibiotics (e.g., Erythromycin-based) to kill the bacteria directly. While effective at clearing the visual symptom, this is a "scorched earth" tactic. It risks collapsing the biofilter, stressing corals, and often leads to a recurrence because the underlying chemical imbalance (the open niche) remains unsolved.

## Practical Application

### Diagnosis & Immediate Action
1.  **Map the Outbreak:** Identify low-flow dead spots versus high-light areas. Syphon out as much of the mat as possible immediately. This is not just cosmetic; it physically exports the nutrients the colony has sequestered.
2.  **Test the "Big 3":** Measure Nitrate (NO3), Phosphate (PO4), and if possible, send an N-DOC test.
    *   *Scenario A (Low Nutrient):* NO3 is 0, PO4 is >0.03. **Action:** Dose Nitrate (or feed heavier) to bring NO3 up to 2-5ppm. This allows beneficial organisms to grow and outcompete the cyano.
    *   *Scenario B (High Nutrient):* Both are sky-high. **Action:** Increase mechanical filtration, wet skimming, and consider a temporary reduction in photoperiod or intensity.
3.  **Flow Audit:** Re-aim powerheads to turbulent flow patterns. Cyanobacteria hates random, chaotic flow that prevents mat adhesion.

### Treatment Protocol (Tiered)
*   **Step 1 (Correction):** Correct N:P ratio and manually siphon daily for 3-5 days. Add competing bacteria (e.g., Microbacter7).
*   **Step 2 (Inhibition - Triton Recommended):** If parameters are fixed but cyano persists, use a non-antibiotic inhibitor like Triton CYA-NO. This serves as a stressor to tip the balance in favor of the clean-up crew.
*   **Step 3 (Chemical - Last Resort):** Use Chemiclean or similar. **CRITICAL:** Remove carbon, turn off UV, and *maximize aeration* with airstones. The tank's oxygen demand will spike, risking a crash if not aerated. Perform a 20% water change 48 hours later.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Parameter | Target Range | Note | Source |
|-----------|--------------|------|--------|
| Nitrate (NO3) | 2.0 - 5.0 ppm | Ideal target; up to 10 ppm acceptable if PO4 balanced | [TIER-1] |
| Phosphate (PO4) | 0.02 - 0.06 ppm | Maintain N:P ratio of ~16:1 (Redfield) | [TIER-1] |
| N:C:P Ratio | Balanced | Via N-DOC Analysis | [TIER-1] |
| Flow Rate | 20x-50x Turnover | Chaotic / Random to disrupt mats | [TIER-2] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Oxygen Depletion:** Chemical cyano treatments (Chemiclean/Red Slime Remover) dramatically lower dissolved oxygen. **NEVER** use these without an active airstone or heavy surface agitation. Skimmers alone are often insufficient as they may overflow and need to be dialled back.
*   **Antibiotic Risk:** Frequent use of antibiotic-based treatments can breed resistant strains of bacteria, making future outbreaks harder to treat (Old Tank Syndrome contributor).

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Skimmer Overflow:** Chemical treatments alter water tension. Expect the protein skimmer to flood the cup instantly. Connect the drain to a large bucket or remove the cup entirely during the 48-hour treatment phase.
*   **Post-Treatment Cleanup:** A **20% Water Change** is mandatory 48 hours after using any chemical treatment to remove medication residues and dissolved organics.
*   **Corals & Anemones:** Sensitive invertebrates (especially carpet anemones and SPS) can react poorly to rapid changes in redox potential caused by oxidizers.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] The exact proprietary composition of "non-antibiotic" inhibitors like Triton CYA-NO is trade secret; mechanism is inferred as metabolic disruption.
- [VERIFY] Long-term impact of "chemiclean" usage on rock porosity and microbiome diversity (anecdotal evidence of "bacterial reset" needing verification).
