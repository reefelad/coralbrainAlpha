# Common Coral Pests (AEFW/Red Bugs)

## Overview
In the diverse and competitive ecosystem of a coral reef, numerous organisms have evolved specialized parasitic or predatory relationships with corals. These "pests" are specialized biological agents that exploit the energy reserves, tissue, and defensive mechanisms of their hosts. In a closed aquaculture system, these relationships can quickly become unbalanced, leading to colony decline. The most prominent of these specialists are the Acropora-Eating Flatworms (AEFW) and Red Bugs (*Tegastes acroporanus*).

From a "Discovery First" perspective, these pests are remarkable examples of evolutionary adaptation. They have developed sophisticated camouflage and life-cycle strategies to bypass coral defenses. AEFW, for instance, utilize the "dead zones" of a coral colony—exposed skeletal areas free from stinging nematocysts—as secure sites for egg deposition. Red Bugs are so diminutive that they can occupy the host's mucus and tissue layers without being easily detected by the coral's own biological responses. Understanding these specialized survival strategies is essential for effective biosecurity and management.

## Key Concepts

### Acropora-Eating Flatworms (AEFW)
The AEFW (scientifically referred to as *Prosthiostomum acroporae*) is a polyclad flatworm and an obligate parasite of the *Acropora* genus. [TIER-1]
- **Biological Specialization:** These flatworms consume coral tissue directly, creating circular patches of exposed skeleton known as "bite marks." These marks are often confused with Slow Tissue Necrosis (STN), but close inspection reveals the structured removal of tissue. [TIER-1]
- **Evolutionary Camouflage:** Their translucent bodies can mimic the coloration of the host coral, making them nearly impossible to detect while on the tissue. [TIER-1]
- **Limited Dispersal Strategy:** AEFW larvae are benthonic "crawlers" rather than pelagic swimmers. This lack of a free-swimming larval phase means they disperse slowly but concentrate heavily on individual colonies, leading to rapid, localized destruction before the population eventually migrates to neighboring corals. [TIER-1]
- **Reproduction:** Adults lay brownish, circular egg clusters on bare coral skeleton. The embryos are protected from the coral’s defensive nematocysts, ensuring that juveniles have immediate access to food upon hatching. [TIER-1]

### Red Bugs (*Tegastes acroporanus*)
Red Bugs are minute parasitic copepods that specifically target smooth-skinned *Acropora* corals. [TIER-1]
- **Parasitic Feeding:** They feed on the host's mucus and potentially its internal fluids. While they rarely cause immediate tissue death, they induce chronic stress and metabolic drain. [TIER-2]
- **Observable Impact:** Infestations manifest as poor polyp extension, loss of vibrant coloration (browning), and a marked reduction in growth. [TIER-2]
- **Detection:** They appear as extremely tiny yellow specks with a red core, often requiring high-intensity lighting and magnification to identify. [TIER-2]

### Egg Deposition Strategies
Pests prioritize laying eggs on non-living substrates within the colony structure (exposed skeleton or the base of the coral). This biological tactic ensures the survival of the offspring by avoiding the chemical defenses the coral deploys throughout its living tissue. [TIER-1]

### Broad Spectrum Pests
Other common specialists that employ similar survival tactics include:
- **Montipora-Eating Nudibranchs (MEN):** Small, white, fringed nudibranchs that consume *Montipora* tissue and deposit eggs on the shaded undersides of plates. [TIER-2]
- **Zoanthid-Eating Specialists:** Nudibranchs and spiders that can rapidly decimate Zoanthid colonies. [TIER-2]
- **Vermetid Snails:** Sessile snails that irritate corals with mucus nets, which can cause localized necrosis or impaired feeding. [TIER-2]

## Practical Application

### Biosecurity (Quarantine)
The primary defense against pests is a robust Quarantine (QT) protocol. Assumption of infestation is the safest posture for all new arrivals.
- **Visual Inspection:** Use a magnifying lens to check for egg clusters on the base, plugs, and the tissue itself.
- **Dipping Protocols:** Use commercial oxidative or herbal dips (e.g., Coral Rx, Revive, or Lugol's Iodine) to dislodge adult pests. **Note:** Standard dips do not kill egg capsules. [TIER-2]
- **Physical Removal:** Forcefully blasting the coral with a turkey baster or pump during the dip is necessary to dislodge camouflaged adults and eggs that may be loosely attached.

### Biological Control
Natural predators can serve as a continuous management layer:
- **AEFW:** Four-Line and Six-Line Wrasses (*Pseudocheilinus* spp.) and various *Halichoeres* wrasses (e.g., Yellow Coris Wrasse) are documented flatworm predators. [TIER-2]
- **Red Bugs:** Dragonface Pipefish (*Corythoichthys haematopterus*) are effective, specialized predators for these tiny copepods. [TIER-2]

### Intervention Strategies
- **AEFW:** In-tank chemical treatments are not verified as 100% safe for the microbiome. The recommended protocol involves a vigorous dipping schedule for all *Acropora* every 7–10 days for 6-8 weeks to break the life cycle (matching incubation times). [TIER-2]
- **Red Bugs:** Historically treated with Milbemycin oxime (Interceptor). 
  - ⚠️ **Critical Warning:** Interceptor is a broad-spectrum parasitic treatment that will kill **all** crustaceans in the system, including beneficial crabs and shrimp.
  - ⚠️ **Commensal Mortality:** This treatment will also kill beneficial commensal *Acropora* crabs (e.g., *Trapezia* and *Tetralia* spp.) which are part of the coral's natural defense system. [TIER-2]

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Pest Type | Primary Host | Detection Key | Biological Control |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| AEFW | *Acropora* | Bite marks (vs STN), skeleton eggs | *Halichoeres* Wrasses |
| Red Bugs | *Acropora* | Magnification (yellow/red dots) | Dragonface Pipefish |
| MEN | *Montipora* | Underside white fringe/eggs | Yellow Coris Wrasse |
| Snail Pests | General | Shell presence/mucus nets | Manual removal |

| AEFW Hatching Cycle | Duration | Biological Dependency |
|---------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| Egg Incubation | 10-21 Days | Temperature dependent |
| Hatching to Juveniles | Immediate | Requires *Acropora* within 5 days |
| Maturity | ~21 Days | Complete cycle 30-45 days |

## Safety Considerations

### ⚠️ TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):
- **Stability prioritised:** Never prioritize "perfect" pest-free status over system stability. If a treatment causes a significant metabolic crash or alkalinity swing, the cure may be more lethal than the pest.
- **pH and Salinity:** Always match the dip water's parameters (Temperature, pH, Salinity) to the aquarium water to avoid osmotic or thermal shock.

### ⚠️ TIER 2 DEFAULTS:
- **Max Dip Duration:** 15 minutes. Long-term exposure to chemical dips can lead to tissue "burn" and coral mortality. [TIER-2]
- **Aeration:** Active water movement during a dip is mandatory to ensure gas exchange and prevent pH drops in small volume containers. [TIER-2]

## Interfaces

- **Depends on:** 04_coral_biology (Knowledge of host tissue/skeleton site locations)
- **Informs:** 24_predictive_indicators (Visual signs like "bite marks" as lead indicators for intervention)

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] The biochemical mechanism through which AEFW larvae "smell" their *Acropora* hosts after hatching is not fully characterized. [TIER-1]
- [VERIFY] The extent to which Triton method macro-algae refugiums might harbor or export pest larvae.
- [GAP] Long-term impact of sub-lethal pest populations on coral calcification and skeletal density in high-stability systems.
