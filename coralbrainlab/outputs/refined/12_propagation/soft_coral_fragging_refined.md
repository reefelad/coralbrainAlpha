# Soft Coral Propagation

## Overview

Soft corals, including popular genera like Sarcophyton (toadstool leathers), Sinularia (finger leathers), Lobophytum, and various mushroom corals (Discosoma, Rhodactis), lack the rigid calcium carbonate skeleton of their stony relatives. Their bodies are composed primarily of soft tissue supported by internal spicules—microscite calcite needles embedded within the coenenchyme (connective tissue).

This fundamental difference in body structure makes soft coral fragging **simpler in execution but different in mounting**. Soft corals heal remarkably well from cuts because their tissue is designed to flex and regenerate. However, their slimy outer layer (mucus production is a constant feature) prevents direct adhesion with cyanoacrylate glue. The key challenge is not the cutting—it's securing the frag until natural attachment occurs.

## Key Concepts

### The Terpenoid Defense System

When stressed or cut, leather corals release **terpenoids**—allelopathic (chemical warfare) compounds that inhibit nearby coral growth and can stress tank mates. This is a natural defense mechanism that intensifies during fragging [TIER-2: Reef Builders].

**Implication:** Fragging should be done in a separate container, and activated carbon should be run in the main system after reintroduction.

### Mucus Coating and Attachment Challenge

Soft coral tissue is perpetually coated in a protective mucus layer. This layer:

- Physically prevents superglue from bonding to tissue.
- Sloughs off periodically as part of the coral's natural shedding process.
- Increases in production when the coral is stressed.

**Implication:** Mechanical attachment methods (toothpicks, rubber bands) are preferred over glue [TIER-2: BRS].

### Toadstool Anatomy: Cap vs. Stalk

Sarcophyton toadstools have two distinct zones:

- **Cap (Capitulum):** The flat disc where polyps emerge. This is the metabolically active growth zone.
- **Stalk (Column):** The supporting stem without polyps. This can be cut to shorten the coral or create new frags.

Both cap and stalk tissue have regenerative capacity, allowing for multiple fragging strategies [TIER-2: Atlanta Reef Club].

## Practical Application

### Workflow: Fragging Toadstool Leather (Sarcophyton)

1.  **Prepare Workspace:** Fill two containers with tank water—one for cutting, one for rinsing.
2.  **Remove Coral:** Transfer the toadstool to the cutting container. Allow to settle.
3.  **Choose Cut Strategy:**
    - **Pizza slice method:** Cut the cap into wedges (like a pizza), each with a portion of the stalk attached.
    - **Ring cut method:** Cut a ring around the outer edge of the cap, leaving the center and stalk intact. The ring pieces become frags.
    - **Stalk cut:** Slice the stalk horizontally to reduce height; the base will regenerate.
4.  **Make Clean Cuts:** Use sharp scissors or razor blade. Avoid sawing motions.
5.  **Rinse:** Transfer frags to the rinse container to wash away slime.
6.  **Iodine Dip (Optional):** Dip in Lugol's solution for 2-5 minutes to disinfect.
7.  **Mount Using Toothpick Method:**
    - Skewer the frag with half a toothpick.
    - Apply cyanoacrylate gel to a frag plug.
    - Insert the toothpick into the glue (the coral tissue does not touch glue).
    - Allow to cure.
8.  **Alternative: Rubber Band Method:**
    - Wrap frag loosely around a piece of rubble rock.
    - Secure with a rubber band—not tight enough to cut tissue.
    - Remove rubber band after 1-2 weeks when attached.
9.  **Run Activated Carbon:** After returning frags/mother to the display, run GAC for 24-48 hours.

### Workflow: Fragging Sinularia (Finger Leather)

1.  As a branching coral, Sinularia is fragged by cutting individual fingers at the base.
2.  Use the toothpick or rubber band method to mount.
3.  Sinularia attaches relatively quickly (1-2 weeks).

### Workflow: Fragging Mushrooms (Passive Method)

Mushroom corals often propagate themselves by pedal laceration. You can encourage this:

1.  Place the mushroom on a piece of rubble in a low-flow area.
2.  Over weeks, the mushroom will leave tissue at the edges that develops into new polyps.
3.  For faster results: carefully slice the mushroom disc into 2-4 pieces; each piece will regenerate a full polyp.

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**

- **Terpenoid Toxicity:** Never frag leather corals in your display tank. The released chemicals can harm other corals, especially SPS [TIER-1].

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**

- **Waxy Film:** Toadstools may shed a waxy film post-frag. Siphon this off to prevent irritation to other corals.
- **Polyp Retraction:** Expect polyps to remain retracted for several days post-frag—this is normal.
