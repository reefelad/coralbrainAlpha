# Trace & Minor Elements

## Overview
If Major Elements build the house, Trace Elements furnish it. While Major Elements (Alk/Ca/Mg) make up the bulk of the skeletal structure and water chemistry, Trace Elements act as the spark plugs for biological engines. They are the essential co-factors for enzymes, the creators of pigment (chromoproteins), and the defenders against oxidative stress.

In the open ocean, these elements are constantly replenished by upwelling and currents. In an aquarium, they are rapidly stripped by coral uptake, skimmers, and chemical filtration. Conversely, impurities in foods and equipment can cause toxic accumulation. The management of Trace Elements is what separates a tank where corals merely "survive" from one where they dramatically "thrive" with vibrant coloration.

## Key Concepts

### Macro-Trace Elements
Elements present in significant concentrations, but less than Major Elements.
*   **Potassium (K):** (~400 ppm) Critical for cellular function and transport. Deficiency leads to pale/grey Montipora and loss of pink/red coloration.
*   **Strontium (Sr):** (~8 ppm) Coprecipitates with Calcium into the skeleton. Facilitates calcification.
*   **Boron (B):** (~4.5 ppm) Contributes to alkalinity and pH buffering.

### The Halogens (I/F/Br)
*   **Iodine (I):** Essential for gorgonians and soft corals, but also a potent antioxidant for stony corals. Helps corals manage light stress (UV protection). Very volatile and hard to test manually.
*   **Fluorine (F):** Involved in calcification and tissue integrity.
*   **Bromine (Br):** Preserves the ratio with Chlorine.

### Physiologically Relevant Metals (Fe/Zn/Mn/V/Mo)
Often toxic at high levels (Heavy Metals) but essential at trace levels.
*   **Iron (Fe):** Limiting nutrient for zooxanthellae (green coloration) and macroalgae. Utilization is extremely rapid.
*   **Manganese (Mn):** Protects against oxidative stress / bleaching.
*   **Zinc (Zn), Vanadium (V), Molybdenum (Mo):** Enzyme co-factors for bacterial processes and coral metabolism.

## Practical Application

### The "No Blind Dosing" Rule
Adding "Broad Spectrum" trace element bottles without testing is dangerous. You cannot know consumption rates without measuring.
*   **Accumulation Risk:** Metals like Copper or Zinc can accumulate to toxic levels if dosed blindly.
*   **The Solution:** ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry).

### Management Strategy
1.  **Baseline Testing:** Run an ICP analysis (e.g., Triton Lab) every 1-3 months.
2.  **Maintenance Dosing:** Daily low-level dosing of elements known to be consumed (Mn, I, V, Zn) based on system volume and coral load.
3.  **Correction Dosing:** One-off corrections to fix deficiencies found in ICP tests.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

### Triton / Recommended Targets
| Group | Element | Range (NSW) | Triton Rec. | Source |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Macro-Trace | Potassium (K) | 380 - 420 ppm | 400 ppm | [TIER-1] |
| Macro-Trace | Strontium (Sr) | 8 ppm | 8 - 10 ppm | [TIER-1] |
| Halogen | Iodine (I) | 0.06 ppm | 0.06 - 0.09 ppm | [TIER-1] |
| Metal | Iron (Fe) | < 0.001 ppm | Monitor / Dose small amount | [TIER-1] |

*Note: Many heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Ni) have targets in the ppb (parts per billion) or µg/L range.*

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Copper Toxicity:** Copper is lethal to invertebrates at low levels (>20-30 ppb typically dangerous, therapeutic levels for fish are lethal to corals). NEVER dose copper medications in a reef tank.
*   **Reef-Safe Limit:** Triton typically flags Copper > 10 ppb as requiring attention.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Iodine Overdose:** Iodine is antiseptic. Massive overdose can sterilize the tank. Stick to recommended dosage limits (max 0.15 ppm acute).

## Interfaces
*   **Connects to:** [02_lighting] (Trace elements provide pigments for light protection).
*   **Depends on:** [10_testing_protocols] (ICP Testing).
*   **Informs:** [35_growth_optimisation] (Coloration and growth enzymes).

## Gaps / Open Questions
*   [GAP] The exact biological role of rare metals like Lithium (Li) and Cobalt (Co) in coral physiology is still under research.
*   [VERIFY] Efficacy of "Bio-available" iron supplements vs chelated iron in high-pH seawater.
