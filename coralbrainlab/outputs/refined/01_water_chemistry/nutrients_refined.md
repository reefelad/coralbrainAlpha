# Nutrients (NO3/PO4/N:P)

## Overview
In the past, reefkeeping philosophy centered on "nutrient export"—the relentless drive to strip water of "pollutants" like Nitrate and Phosphate. We now understand that these are not pollutants, but essential **nutrients**. The coral holobiont—specifically the symbiotic *Symbiodiniaceae* (zooxanthellae) living within the coral tissue—requires Nitrogen and Phosphorus to photosynthesize and reproduce.

Without adequate nutrients, corals starve. They bleach (expel zooxanthellae) not because of heat, but because the payout of sugar from the algae isn't worth the cost of housing them if the algae can't pay "rent" (nutrients). Conversely, excessive nutrients can fuel unwanted algae growth and inhibit calcification. The modern goal is not *elimination* (0.00 ppm), but *control*—maintaining low but detectable levels to fuel biology without fueling pests.

## Key Concepts

### Nitrate ($NO_3$)
Nitrate is the primary source of Nitrogen for the reef.
*   **Biological Role:** Required for amino acid synthesis and zooxanthellae growth.
*   **Starvation:** Levels < 0.5 ppm can lead to pale corals and starvation.
*   **Excess:** Levels > 20-50 ppm can cause browning (zooxanthellae overpopulation) and fuel nuisance algae.

### Phosphate ($PO_4$)
Phosphate is the primary source of Phosphorus.
*   **Biological Role:** Essential for ATP (energy) transfer and DNA synthesis.
*   **Starvation:** Levels of 0.00 ppm are dangerous. "Zero Phosphate" often leads to rapid tissue necrosis (RTN) and dinoflagellate outbreaks.
*   **Calcification Inhibition:** High Phosphate (> 0.1 ppm or significantly higher) can chemically interfere with the precipitation of calcium carbonate, slowing growth.
*   **Source:** [TIER-1: "Effects of phosphate on calcification" - various papers]

### The Ratio (N:P)
The balance between Nitrogen and Phosphorus is often cited as the Redfield Ratio (16:1 atomic, or ~10:1 by mass in aquariums).
*   **Imbalance:** If Nitrate is high and Phosphate is zero, corals starve (limited by P). If Phosphate is high and Nitrate is zero, corals starve (limited by N) and Cyanobacteria (which can fix atmospheric Nitrogen) often take over.
*   **Source:** [TIER-2: Redfield Ratio application effectively debated in reefing, but concept of limiting nutrient is solid biology].

## Practical Application

### Managing Levels
*   **Raising:** Feeding more (Particulate/Amino Acids) or dosing Sodium Nitrate / Trisodium Phosphate.
*   **Lowering:**
    *   **Biological:** Refugium (Macroalgae export), Carbon Dosing (Bacterial export).
    *   **Chemical:** GFO (Granular Ferric Oxide) or Lanthanum Chloride for Phosphate. Sulfur Denitrator for Nitrate.
    *   **Mechanical:** Fleece rollers, Skimmers (remove precursors).

### Troubleshooting
*   **Pale Colors:** Check for low Nutrients.
*   **Brown Corals:** Check for high Nutrients.
*   **Green Film Algae:** (Soft dusting on glass) Often healthy/normal. Indicates nutrients are available for biology.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

### Triton / Recommended Targets
| Parameter | Natural Seawater (NSW) | Triton Rec. | Safety Low | Safety High | Source |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|
| Nitrate ($NO_3$) | < 0.1 ppm | 2 - 10 ppm | 0.5 ppm | 50 ppm | [TIER-1] |
| Phosphate ($PO_4$) | < 0.005 ppm | 0.018 - 0.08 ppm | 0.01 ppm | 0.2 ppm | [TIER-1] |

*Note: Triton (and most modern methods) recommend elevated levels compared to NSW to prevent starvation in closed systems.*

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Zero Phosphate:** NEVER strip Phosphate to true 0.00 ppm. This is a primary trigger for Dinoflagellates and RTN.
*   **Rapid Reduction:** DO NOT drop Nitrate or Phosphate rapidly. Shock can kill corals (especially SPS) faster than high levels can.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Reduction limit:** Max 25% reduction per week recommended for established high-nutrient tanks to avoid shock.

## Interfaces
*   **Connects to:** [08_microbiology] (Bacteria consume nutrients/Carbon dosing).
*   **Depends on:** [07_filtration_science] (Methods of export).
*   **Informs:** [06_pests_diseases] (Algae/Dino outbreaks).

## Gaps / Open Questions
*   [GAP] Exact impact of very high Nitrate (>100 ppm) on coral health in the absence of Phosphate limitation.
*   [VERIFY] Effectiveness of specific "bottled bacteria" products for targeted Nitrate reduction.
