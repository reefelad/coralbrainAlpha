# Amino Acids & Vitamins

## Overview
Amino acids and vitamins are the fundamental organic "molecular toolkits" required for coral vitality, structural integrity, and immune defense. While corals obtain the bulk of their metabolic energy (sugars) from their symbiotic zooxanthellae, they cannot build new tissue, repair damage, or produce complex pigments without a steady supply of Nitrogen-rich amino acids and specific vitamin cofactors. In a reef environment, these are absorbed directly from the water column or ingested through prey.

Corals utilize amino acids not only for soft tissue growth but also to construct the **organic matrix**—the proteinaceous "glue" that binds calcium carbonate crystals together into a solid skeleton. Vitamins, particularly the B-complex and Vitamin C, serve as critical cofactors in metabolic pathways and immune responses. In the closed environment of an aquarium, managing the supply of these organics is a balance between providing for thriving growth and avoiding the excess organic load that leads to nuisance algae and cyanobacteria outbreaks.

## Key Concepts

### Protein Synthesis & The Organic Matrix
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. In corals, specific amino acids like Aspartic Acid, Glutamic Acid, and Glycine are essential for the production of the skeletal organic matrix. This matrix acts as a biological template for calcification, influencing skeletal strength and linear extension rates. Without these building blocks, corals may produce "chalky" or brittle skeletons even in the presence of optimal alkalinity. [TIER-1: PNAS / Marine Biology Research]

### Direct Absorption & Saturation Limits
Corals absorb dissolved organic compounds (including aminos) directly from the water column through specialized carrier proteins in their epidermis. However, these transporters have a **saturation point**—a threshold beyond which the coral cannot absorb molecules any faster, regardless of concentration. Dosing beyond this limit is essentially waste, contributing directly to the Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) pool and fueling nuisance microbes. [TIER-1: Coral Physiology Textbooks]

### Vitamin Cofactors & Stress Resilience
- **B-Complex Vitamins:** Essential for energy metabolism and cellular regeneration.
- **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):** A powerful antioxidant that aids in tissue repair and collagen synthesis, particularly after fragmentation or accidental injury.
- **Vitamin E:** Protects cellular membranes from oxidative stress during high-light or high-temperature events. [TIER-2: Expert Consensus / BRS]

### The Triton Biogenerator vs. Targeted Dosing
In the Triton methodology, a thriving macroalgae refugium acts as a "living biogenerator," naturally releasing a spectrum of aminos and vitamins that are often sufficient for balanced reefs. For systems requiring additional nutrition, Triton utilizes a **Crystalline Feeding System** (N-FUSE and X-PAND) designed to encapsulate these organic nutrients into crystalline structures for targeted uptake, minimizing the spill-over into the general DOC pool.

## Practical Application

### Dosing & The Organic Load
- **DOC Awareness:** Amino acid dosing contributes both Nitrogen and Carbon to the system. This contribution must be accounted for in the overall DOC management strategy (monitored via N-DOC testing).
- **ULNS Strategy:** In ultra-low nutrient systems, daily dosing is often critical to prevent "starvation in the light," where corals have energy but lack building blocks.
- **Automated Delivery:** Delivering aminos via a dosing pump in small, frequent amounts throughout the day/night is superior to "pulse" dosing, as it maintains a constant availability below the coral's saturation threshold.

### Warning Signs of Overdosing
- **Cyanobacteria Outbreaks:** A primary indicator of excess amino acid/vitamin availability. Cyano can rapidly consume simple organics that corals fail to absorb.
- **Darkening Tissue (Browning):** Excessive amino acids fuel zooxanthellae population explosions, leading to a "browned out" appearance that masks the coral's natural decorative pigments.
- **Microbial Film:** Rapid accumulation of green or white bacterial film on mechanical filtration or glass.

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Oxygen Demand:** Rapid overdosing of concentrated organic solutions can trigger a bacterial bloom (heterotrophic bloom) that strips dissolved oxygen from the water, potentially leading to lethal levels (<4 mg/L) in hours.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Cyano / Dinos:** If Cyanobacteria or Dinoflagellates are detected, immediately suspend all amino acid and vitamin dosing until the microbial balance is restored.
- **Purity standards:** Only use "Reef-Safe" organic supplements; standard human vitamins often contain preservatives or trace heavy metals (e.g., Copper) that are highly toxic to invertebrates.

## Interfaces

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] The exact "ideal" ratio of specific amino acids for individual families is not yet defined; current products use a generalized spectrum.
- [VERIFY] The degree of degradation or "stripping" of amino acids in systems with high-wattage Ozone (O3) or UV sterilization.

## Refinement Summary (FOR COMPILER - REMOVE FROM FINAL)

**Critic Verdict:** PASS
**Issues Addressed:**
- [Organic Load Relationship]: Linked amino acid contribution to the broad DOC pool and N-DOC management.
- [Triton Specificity]: Incorporated Triton's N-FUSE crystalline delivery methodology as the preferred supplemental path.
- [Absorption Saturation]: Added the "Saturation Point" concept to explain why overdosing is pollutive rather than productive.

**Unresolved Items:**
- None.

**Quality Confidence:** HIGH
