# Critique Report: Calcification Mechanisms

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 violations found. The report explicitly references the 2.0 dKH/day absolute limit and pH 7.5-8.8 range.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is scientifically robust and aligns perfectly with the Triton methodology. It follows the "Discovery First" principle by clearly explaining the biological mechanisms (sub-calicoblastic space, proton pumps) before addressing technical parameters.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Navigation Footer Missing**
   - Location: End of document
   - Problem: The document is missing the standardized navigation footer required by the CoralBrainLab core template.
   - Suggested fix: Add the navigation block connecting to the domain index, skeleton, and next subdomain (zooxanthellae_symbiosis.md).

2. **Source Classification for Barium**
   - Location: Gaps / Open Questions
   - Problem: The [VERIFY] tag for Barium mentions its impact but doesn't explicitly link to a potential reason why this is a gap (e.g., conflicting reports in hobbyist vs scientific literature).
   - Suggested fix: Clarify that Barium is often elevated in closed systems using GFO, making its impact on specific species a practical concern for aquarists.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Clarification on Bicarbonate vs Carbonate:** While the overview mentions pumping in "calcium and bicarbonate," it could be slightly more explicit about the ratio (2:1 bicarbonate to calcium for charge balance) to aid in future algorithmic modeling.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: REVISE (Navigation missing)

## Verdict: PASS
Proceed to Refiner. The content is excellent; the refiner just needs to add the structural footer and polish the barium gap description.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add standardized Navigation footer.
2. Clarify the Barium [VERIFY] gap with context about GFO usage.
3. Enhance the "Magnesium as a Kinetic Inhibitor" section to explain WHY it's important to keep at 1350ppm (to prevent abiotic precipitation on equipment).
