# Critique Report: Coral Anatomy & Physiology

## Safety Audit: PASS
- TIER 1 Alkalinity stability mentioned correctly (max 2.0 dKH/day).
- Temperature extremes (>32°C) and bleaching correctly identified as TIER 1 risks.
- No unsafe recommendations found.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is excellent and adheres strongly to the "Discovery First" philosophy. It correctly identifies the coral as a meta-organism and provides a clear scientific basis for husbandry practices.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Biomineralization Depth]**
   - Location: Key Concepts > 3. Biomineralization & The Calicodermis
   - Problem: While accurate, it misses the specific mechanism of proton (H+) pumping which is the primary reason why high pH (8.1-8.4) accelerates growth.
   - Suggested fix: Add a sentence explaining that corals must actively pump hydrogen ions (H+) out of the sub-calicoblastic space to raise pH and facilitate aragonite precipitation. This links the "WHY" of pH management to the "HOW" of skeletal growth.

2. **[Gastrovascular Connectivity]**
   - Location: Key Concepts > 2. The Polyp & Coelenteron
   - Problem: It mentions the coenosarc but doesn't explicitly state that the gastrovascular cavities of polyps are often interconnected, allowing for nutrient sharing across the colony.
   - Suggested fix: Clarify that the coelenteron is part of a colonial network, allowing the system to act as a single physiological unit.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Mucus Layer** — Mentioning the "Mucus Ciliary System" as a primary defense/waste mechanism would add depth to the Practical Application section (e.g., why corals "slime" when stressed).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is high-quality, scientifically accurate, and aligns perfectly with project goals. The suggested fixes will further enhance the "Discovery First" value.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Include proton pump (pH regulation) in Biomineralization section.
2. Explicitly mention colonial nutrient sharing via the gastrovascular network.
3. Add a note on mucus production as an anatomical defense mechanism.
