# Critique Report: Zooxanthellae Symbiosis

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations found. Temperature and nutrient ranges are within conservative, stability-focused limits.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is scientifically robust, follows the "Discovery First" principles, and aligns well with Triton methodology. It provides a clear biological explanation for the necessity of nutrient limitation and the mechanics of bleaching.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **[Navigation Footer Missing]**
   - Location: End of file.
   - Problem: The mandatory navigation footer (specified in the Domain Structure Template of `coralbrainlab-core`) is missing.
   - Required fix: Add the navigation section with links to the Index, Skeleton, and the next subdomain.
   - Safety impact: None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Clarification on Clade Diversity]**
   - Location: Gaps / Open Questions.
   - Problem: While Symbiodiniaceae diversity is mentioned in the [VERIFY] tag, it could be more explicitly integrated into the Practical Application section (e.g., thermal tolerance of *Durusdinium* clades).
   - Suggested fix: Add a brief mention of clade diversity impacting coral resilience in the Key Concepts or Practical Application section.

2. **[Triton-Specific Carbon Management]**
   - Location: Key Concepts - Nutrient Limitation and Triton Ratios.
   - Problem: The mention of Triton N:C:P ratios is good, but could more explicitly mention Triton's use of AL99 or other carbon-based media to manage these ratios if relevant to symbiosis.
   - Suggested fix: Briefly mention how Triton methodology manages the Carbon (C) part of the ratio (e.g., refugium/triton base) in relation to the symbiosis.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Formatting] — Parameter table could include a row for Carbon/Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) since it's mentioned as a dependency in the Interfaces section.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS (except footer)
- [x] Structure: PASS (except footer)

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is of high quality and only requires minor structural additions and some nuanced additions for completeness.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add the mandatory Navigation footer.
2. Integrate clade diversity (Symbiodiniaceae genera) into the "Bleaching Mechanism" or "Practical Application" sections to explain varying resilience.
3. Elaborate slightly on the Carbon (C) aspect of the Triton N-C-P ratio.
