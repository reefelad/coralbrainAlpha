# Critique Report: Microscope Analysis

## Safety Audit: PASS
- Zoonotic risks (Vibrio/Mycobacterium) accurately identified with appropriate warnings.
- Palytoxin-like analog risks from *Ostreopsis* correctly flagged with PPE/ventilation requirements.
- No recommendations violate Tier 1 parameter change limits.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The Generator provided a comprehensive and highly accurate overview of microscopy in reef aquaculture. The biological rationale for microscopy is clearly articulated, and the technical identification markers for pests and parasites align with established marine science.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of file
   - Problem: The raw output did not include the standard navigation footer (Back to Index, Next, etc.) as required by the `coralbrainlab-core` template.
   - Suggested fix: Add the footer in the Refiner stage.

2. **Source Ambiguity**
   - Location: Safety Considerations
   - Problem: "Triton Safety Protocol" is cited for Palytoxin but a specific document or link is not provided.
   - Suggested fix: If a specific Triton knowledge base article exists, reference it more clearly; otherwise, use TIER-1 NOAA/CDC as the primary source for toxin safety.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Staining nuances** — The overview mention of Lugol's is helpful, but mentioning "Neutral Red" or "Methylene Blue" for viability staining could add depth.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS (except footer)

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is technically sound, well-sourced, and adheres to the "Discovery First" principles. The missing footer is a structural minor omission easily corrected in refinement.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add the required navigation footer.
2. Clarify the "Triton Safety Protocol" reference for palytoxin.
3. Add a brief mention of viability staining (e.g., Neutral Red).
