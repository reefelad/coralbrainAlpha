# Critique Report: ICP Sampling Procedures

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations identified. The content correctly emphasizes not making major adjustments based on single samples.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The extraction is comprehensive, accurate, and strongly aligned with the Triton methodology. It follows the Discovery First principles by explaining the atomic-level science before the procedural steps.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None identified.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Clarification]**
   - Location: Practical Application > Sample Collection Protocol
   - Problem: Shipping instructions mention significant delays lead to biological activity but elemental content remains largely stable. While true for major elements, certain trace elements (like phosphorus/phosphate species) or elements that can be biologically sequestered (like Iodine or Iron) may change.
   - Suggested fix: Add a note that while metals remain stable, biological parameters (PO4, NO3, and some labile organics) can shift during transit.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Formatting] — Table header in "Parameter Ranges" has a redundant [TIER-1] in the source column; could be more specific.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document meets all core requirements and provides a high level of detail relevant to both scientific understanding and practical success.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Mention potential biological shifts in samples during long shipping durations.
2. Ensure the "Next" link correctly points to `microscope_analysis.md`.
