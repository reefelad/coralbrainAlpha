# Critique Report: Cryptic Zones

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations found. The warning regarding "stagnation vs. flow" is appropriate and critical for preventing hydrogen sulfide formation.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
Excellent "Discovery First" explanation of the specific biological function of cryptic zones (the sponge loop). The distinction between "settling" and "stagnation" is well-made. Content relies on solid scientific backing (de Goeij et al.) and established hobbyist methodology.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Navigation Footer Missing**
   - Location: End of file
   - Problem: The raw output does not include the standard navigation links required by the domain template.
   - Suggested fix: Add the standard navigation footer linking back to the domain index and skeleton.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
1. **Clarification on Triton Context** — Location: Practical Application. It would be beneficial to explicitly state that this *complements* the standard Triton Algae Refugium, rather than replacing it, to avoid confusion for strict Triton method adherents.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS (Good mix of Tier 1 science and Tier 2 application)
- [x] Discovery First: PASS (Strong biological context)
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS (Except navigation)

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is safe, scientifically grounded, and well-structured. The only missing element is the navigation footer, which is easily added during refinement.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add the standard navigation footer.
2. Add a brief note clarifying that cryptic zones coexist with/complement Triton Algae Refugiums.
