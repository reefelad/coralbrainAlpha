# Critique Report: Refugium Design

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 safety violations found. The warnings regarding *Caulerpa* sporulation and pump clogging are appropriate and critical.

## Quality Score: 8.5/10

## Summary
The content is strong, accurate, and deeply aligned with the Triton Method. The "Discovery First" overview uses an excellent "kidneys of the ecosystem" analogy. The key technical requirements (10-20% volume, 10x flow) are correctly identified. However, one specific restriction—the prohibition of mechanical filtration *before* the refugium—needs to be made explicit to prevent common user errors.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Methodology Clarity]**
   - Location: Practical Application / Construction & Layout
   - Problem: The text mentions the refugium should be the "first chamber," but does not explicitly forbid the use of filter socks or fleece rollers *before* this chamber. Many hobbyists habitually place socks on the drain lines.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly state that **no mechanical filtration (socks, floss, rollers)** should be used on the drains entering the refugium. The algae bed is intended to receive raw, detritus-rich water.

2. **[Light Spectrum Detail]**
   - Location: Practical Application / Lighting
   - Problem: "Growth spectrum" is vague. 
   - Suggested fix: Specify the peak wavelengths often used (e.g., 660nm Deep Red and 450nm Royal Blue) or the specific Kelvin (3000K-6500K) typically recommended for macroalgae, distinguishing it further from "Reef Spec" (14000K+) lighting.

3. **[Maintenance Specifics]**
   - Location: Practical Application
   - Problem: "Harvesting" is mentioned in the search summary but less emphasized in the generated text's *Practical Application* section (implied in passing).
   - Suggested fix: Add a specific bullet point on **"Harvesting Strategy"**—removing 30-50% of the algae mass regularly to export the bound nutrients and encourage new rapid growth. Old, slow-growing algae consumes less nitrate/phosphate.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **[Typos]** "fast-growing" in Macroalgae Selection start of sentence should be capitalized? (Actually it's inside a list, but check grammar).
- **[Heading]** "Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables" table indicates "Media: Chaetomorpha", which is correct, but maybe strictly not a "Parameter". It fits fine though.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: [PASS]
- [x] Triton alignment: [PASS]
- [x] Source quality: [PASS]
- [x] Discovery First: [PASS]
- [x] Completeness: [PASS]
- [x] Structure: [PASS]

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** Excellent foundation. Requires only the addition of the "No Socks" rule and explicit "Harvesting" instruction to be considered a complete guide.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add the "No Mechanical Filtration Before Refugium" rule (Triton differentiation).
2. Add a section or bullet on "Harvesting Frequency & Amount".
3. Refine lighting spectrum specifics (660nm/450nm mentions).
