# Critique Report: Biological Filtration

## Safety Audit: PASS
No safety violations found. The content correctly identifies the risks of copper absorption and hydrogen sulfide.

## Quality Score: 8/10

## Summary
The content provides a strong scientific foundation for biological filtration, adhering well to the "Discovery First" principle. It accurately distinguishes between the "how" (media types) and the "why" (ecosystem function). The alignment with Triton's methodology regarding live rock and refugiums is excellent.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of file
   - Problem: The document lacks the standard navigation footer required by the domain template.
   - Required fix: Add the standard navigation footer linking to the index and previous/next modules.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Flow Requirements Distinction**
   - Location: "Key Concepts" -> "The Bacterial Engine" & "Denitrification"
   - Problem: While flow is mentioned, the specific contrast between flow requirements for Nitrification (high turnover) vs. Denitrification (slow pass/diffusion) could be sharper.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly state that different zones of the same rock/media handle these processes due to flow gradients.

2. **Clogging Mechanism Detail**
   - Location: "Critical Components" -> "High-Surface Area Artificial Media"
   - Problem: It mentions clogging, but could be specific about *biofilm* clogging vs *detritus* clogging. Bacterial slime coats can block micropores just as effectively as dirt.
   - Suggested fix: Add a note that "active bacterial slime" itself contributes to pore closure over time.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Source Specificity**: The citation `[TIER-1: Scientific Consensus]` is a bit generic. Can we cite a specific textbook or general reefkeeping standard (e.g., *Delbeek & Sprung*)?
- **Cycle Timeline**: The mention of "months" for maturity is good, but could specify that full stability often takes 6-12 months (biome succession).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS (except footer)
- [x] Structure: PASS (except footer)

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** The content is high quality and accurate, but requires the structural fix of the footer and a slight sharpening of the flow/clogging distinctions to be perfect.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add the domain navigation footer.
2. Clarify the flow gradient requirements for nitrification vs. denitrification.
3. Distinguish between detritus clogging and bacterial biofilm pore closure.
