# Critique Report: Mechanical Filtration Principles

## Safety Audit: PASS
No Tier 1 or Tier 2 safety violations identified. The recommendation for maintenance frequency (2-4 days) is consistent with preventing nutrient spikes.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is scientifically sound and excellently aligned with the Triton Methodology's specific stance on mechanical filtration. It successfully applies the 'Discovery First' principle.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: Bottom of file
   - Problem: The required navigation footer with links to the index, skeleton, and next subdomain is missing.
   - Required fix: Add the standard navigation footer according to the domain template.
   - Safety impact: N/A (Structural requirement)

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Interface Links**
   - Location: Interfaces section
   - Problem: Currently uses bracketed placeholders like `[Nutrient Management]` instead of the specific domain/subdomain IDs (e.g., `05_coral_nutrition`).
   - Suggested fix: Update interfaces to use specific IDs or relative paths where appropriate to ensure traceability.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- None identified.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing footer)

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** The content is high quality and accurate, but the missing navigation footer and imprecise interface references require refinement before compilation.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add Navigation Footer.
2. Refine Interface references to use correct domain IDs.
3. Ensure consistent formatting of micron ratings.
