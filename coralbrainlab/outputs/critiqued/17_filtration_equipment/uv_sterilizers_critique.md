# Critique Report: uv_sterilizers

## Safety Audit: PASS
TIER 1 constraints on ocular safety and mercury hazards are well-documented. Heat transfer is also correctly identified as a risk.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content provides a clear technical and philosophical framework. The [CONFLICT] section is particularly important for this project's alignment with Triton.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Chelated Element Breakdown**
   - Location: Practical Application or Interfaces
   - Problem: Doesn't mention that UV-C light can break down chemical chelators used in certain trace element additives or medications.
   - Suggested fix: Add a warning that UV can cause some chelated elements (like Iron) to "fall out" of solution or render specific organic medications inactive.

2. **Wait Time for Post-Cycle**
   - Location: Practical Application
   - Problem: For new systems, running UV during the initial "cycle" can stall the establishment of nitrifying bacteria on surfaces (though they are mostly benthic, the initial colonizers are often pelagic).
   - Suggested fix: Add a recommendation to leave UV off for the first 30 days of a new system's life.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Ozone Synergy** — Interfaces — Could mention that UV-C can be used to destroy residual ozone in a reaction chamber effluent.

## Verification Checklist

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Excellent technical depth. Addressing the chelation and new tank cycle points will make it 10/10.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Address the UV-induced breakdown of chelators and nutrients.
2. Add the "30-day dark" recommendation for new system cycles.
3. Mention the synergy with ozone (destruction of residual O3).
