# Critique Report: fleece_rollers

## Safety Audit: PASS
TIER 1 constraints regarding flood prevention and electrical safety are well-addressed.

## Quality Score: 8/10

## Summary
Good technical overview of fleece rollers. The explanation of "nitrogen loading prevention" aligns well with Discovery First principles.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Triton Sequence Conflict**
   - Location: Key Concepts > The Triton Sequence
   - Problem: Official Triton documentation (e.g., Triton Method Manual) specifically states that the **Algae Refugium must be the FIRST chamber** and that all water from the aquarium should flow INTO the algae first. Placing a fleece roller *before* the algae might be common in general reef-keeping, but it technically deviates from the "Pure Triton" setup where detritus is meant to be processed biologically by the refugium fauna before being exported by the skimmer.
   - Required fix: Document this specific methodology conflict. Note that while many users prefer the roller first for cleanliness, the "Strict Triton" design prioritizes the algae bed as the primary contact point.
   - Safety impact: Low, but affects methodology consistency.

2. **Micro-fauna Removal (Pods)**
   - Location: Overview or Key Concepts
   - Problem: Doesn't address the removal of beneficial micro-fauna (copepods/amphipods).
   - Suggested fix: Add a note on the trade-off between absolute mechanical clarity and the potential removal of pelagic larval stages or micro-fauna that would otherwise feed the reef.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Sensor Failure Modes** — Practical Application — Could mention "float stuck up" (roll keeps advancing) vs "float stuck down" (bypass).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: REVISE (Need to address the "Algae First" rule)
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** Need to reconcile the placement advice with official Triton guidelines and address micro-fauna trade-offs.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Address the Triton "Algae First" chamber rule and how fleece rollers fit (or conflict) with it.
2. Include the micro-fauna (copepod) exclusion trade-off.
3. Detail sensor failure modes (optical vs. mechanical) more specifically.
