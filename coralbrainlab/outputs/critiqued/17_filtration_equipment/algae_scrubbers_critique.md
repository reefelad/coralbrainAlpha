# Critique Report: algae_scrubbers

## Safety Audit: PASS
TIER 1 constraints on thermal management and nutrient bottoming out are correctly identified.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is technically sound and adheres well to the "Discovery First" principle. It effectively navigates the tension between aggressive technical solutions (ATS/Reactors) and the more holistic Triton approach.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Yellowing Water (GAC Interface)**
   - Location: Practical Application or Overview
   - Problem: Doesn't mention that heavy algae growth often releases organic pigments (phenols/yellowing compounds) into the water, which can reduce PAR penetration in the display tank.
   - Suggested fix: Link this to the need for Activated Carbon (GAC) to maintain water clarity, especially in mature algal-filtered systems.

2. **Refugium Pests**
   - Location: Key Concepts
   - Problem: Doesn't mention the risk of the refugium becoming a reservoir for pests (e.g., flatworms, vermetid snails) that can then re-infest the display.
   - Suggested fix: Add a note on maintaining hygiene in the filtration area.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Chaeto "Meltdown"** — Practical Application — Briefly explain that a sudden "meltdown" (disintegration) of Chaetomorpha is often caused by a lack of a single trace element (often Iron) or a sudden nitrate bottom-out.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** High-quality content that correctly identifies the biological trade-offs and safety risks.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Detail the relationship between algae growth, water yellowing, and carbon usage.
2. Address the "refugium as a pest reservoir" risk.
3. Include the "Chaeto Meltdown" diagnostic trigger.
