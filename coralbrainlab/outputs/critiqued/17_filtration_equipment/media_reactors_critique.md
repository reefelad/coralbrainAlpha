# Critique Report: media_reactors

## Safety Audit: PASS
TIER 1 constraints on PO4 stripping rates and media dust hazards are handled with appropriate gravity. The distinction between GFO and AL99 flow requirements is a critical safety detail.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is technically precise and provides actionable, methodology-specific guidance (Triton vs. standard). Discovery First principles are applied well in the Overview.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Exothermic Reaction (AL99)**
   - Location: Practical Application or Key Concepts
   - Problem: Doesn't mention that high-quality aluminum oxide (AL99) can have a mild exothermic (heat-releasing) "fizzing" reaction when first hitting water or being rinsed. 
   - Suggested fix: Add a "Pre-rinsing" note explaining that fizzing and heat during rinsing is normal for AL99 and it must be rinsed until this stops before being added to a reactor.

2. **Silicate Removal**
   - Location: Overview or Key Concepts
   - Problem: Doesn't explicitly mention that GFO and AL99 also remove Silicates (SiO2).
   - Suggested fix: Add Silicate removal as a benefit, as this is critical for controlling Diatom outbreaks.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Carbon and ORP** — Practical Application — Could mention that fresh Carbon often causes a temporary spike in ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential), which is a good indicator of successful adsorption but should be monitored if using Ozone.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Technically excellent, provides the right level of depth for a predictive AI training set.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Include the AL99 exothermic rinsing warning.
2. Mention Silicate removal in the Phosphate section.
3. Link Carbon usage to ORP response.
