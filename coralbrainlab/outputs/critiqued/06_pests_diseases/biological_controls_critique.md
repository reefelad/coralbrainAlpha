# Critique Report: Biological Pest Controls

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 violations found. The document explicitly advises against relying solely on biological controls for high-risk pests like AEFW, which aligns with safety protocols.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
A strong, accurate, and safe guide to biological pest control. The distinction between specialists and generalists is well-explained, and the warnings regarding starvation and compatibility are crucial. The content aligns well with Triton's widespread disapproval of chemical "quick fixes" where natural alternatives exist.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None found.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Bristle Worm Context**
   - Location: Table (Line 61)
   - Problem: Listing "Bristle Worms" as a target implies they are inherently bad. Most common bristle worms are beneficial detritivores.
   - Suggested fix: Clarify this is for *fireworms* or "excessive populations", or add a note that standard bristle worms are beneficial.

2. **Vermetid Snails Gap**
   - Location: Common Biological Control Agents
   - Problem: Vermetid snails are a very common pest not mentioned.
   - Suggested fix: Consider adding Bumblebee Snails (*Engina sp.*) as a potential (though variable) control agent for Vermetids, as they are frequently sought for this.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Arrow Crab Aggression** — Line 61/71: Arrow crabs can be quite predatory toward small fish and other beneficial inverts (shrimp) when large. Worth emphasizing the risk in the "Crab Risk" warning section.
- **Harlequin Shrimp Diet** — Line 59: Explicitly mention they eat *starfish exclusively* (asterina or chocolate chip feeders) to reinforce the "starvation" risk mentioned in Key Concepts.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS (Minor gaps noted)
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is safe, accurate, and follows the Discovery First principle effectively. It frames biological control not just as a tool but as an ecosystem restoration method.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Contextualize Bristle Worm advice to prevent users from eradicating beneficial detritivores.
2. Add Bumblebee Snails for Vermetid control if scope allows.
3. Reinforce the "safe with caution" nature of Arrow Crabs and Emerald Crabs.
