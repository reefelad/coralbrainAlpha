# Critique Report: Treatment Dips & Baths

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations identified. The report correctly emphasizes temperature and pH matching for dip water and flags the extreme toxicity of insecticides to crustaceans.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is excellent and adheres closely to "Discovery First" principles, explaining the biological and physical mechanisms of various dipping agents. The source tiering is accurate, and the structure is mostly correct.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of file
   - Problem: The navigation footer required by the CoralBrainLab template is missing.
   - Required fix: Add navigation links to Index, Skeleton, and the next subdomain (biological_controls).
2. **Missing Dilution Ratios**
   - Location: Practical Application / Reference Tables
   - Problem: While exposure times are listed, specific dilution ratios for agents like Hydrogen Peroxide and Bayer are omitted.
   - Suggested fix: Add common dilution ratios (e.g., H2O2 1:10 ratio, Bayer 10ml per 250ml tank water).

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Freshwater Dip Duration — Reference Tables: 60 seconds is extremely conservative; for many pests (zoanthid spiders/nudibranchs), 3-5 minutes is often practiced. Consider broadening this range or specifying it for sensitive vs. hardy specimens.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing navigation)

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is scientifically sound and well-extracted. The missing structural element and specific ratios can be easily addressed during the Refine phase.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Implement the required navigation footer.
2. Add specific dilution ratios for the primary dipping agents.
3. Refine the osmotic (freshwater) dip duration details.
