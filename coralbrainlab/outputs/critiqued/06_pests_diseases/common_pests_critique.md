# Critique Report: Common Coral Pests (AEFW/Red Bugs)

## Safety Audit: PASS
- No TIER 1 violations found.
- Stability prioritised correctly.
- Conservative dip advice provided.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is technically accurate, well-referenced, and adheres strongly to the "Discovery First" principle. The biological explanations for pest specialization and life cycle are high quality.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Biological Clarification: Dispersal**
   - Location: Key Concepts > AEFW
   - Problem: AEFW larvae do not have a pelagic (swimmable) phase; they are benthonic crawlers. This is a critical biological "WHY" for their localized infestations.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly state their limited dispersal mechanism and why this leads to rapid localized destruction on a single colony before spreading to neighbors.
2. **Safety: Commensal Crabs**
   - Location: Practical Application > Chemical Treatment
   - Problem: Treatment for Red Bugs (Milbemycin oxime) will kill beneficial commensal Acropora crabs (e.g., *Tetralia* or *Trapezia* spp.).
   - Suggested fix: Add a warning about the loss of beneficial commensal species during treatment, as they often help the coral resist other stressors.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Spelling — Change "Intercepter" to "Interceptor" for accuracy (Practical Application > Chemical Treatment).
- Clarification — Mention that AEFW "bite marks" are often initially confused with STN (Slow Tissue Necrosis).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is excellent, requiring only minor technical nuance and safety warnings regarding commensal organisms before compilation.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add detail on AEFW benthonic crawler dispersal.
2. Add warning about beneficial commensal crab mortality during Red Bug treatment.
3. Correct minor spelling and add the comparison between bite marks and STN.
