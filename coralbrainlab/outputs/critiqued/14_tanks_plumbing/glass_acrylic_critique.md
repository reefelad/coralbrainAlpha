# Critique Report: Glass vs Acrylic Specifications

## Safety Audit: PASS

- No TIER 1 safety violations found.
- Absolute constraints regarding Crazing (chemical failure) and Shatter Risk are clearly identified.
- Warnings on using non-acid cure silicone for glass are needed to prevent bond failure.

## Quality Score: 8/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is technically accurate and well-aligned with Triton's "Stability First" philosophy. However, it lacks specific engineering safety factors and deep detail on joint longevity and UV behavior under intense reef lighting.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **[Silicone Chemical Compatibility]**
   - Location: Practical Application / Safety
   - Problem: Extraction does not specify that ONLY acid-cure (acetoxy) silicone should be used for glass aquarium construction. Neutral-cure silicone has significantly lower adhesion to glass and can fail under sustained hydrostatic pressure.
   - Required fix: Mandate acid-cure silicone for all glass-to-glass structural joints.
   - Safety impact: High (Potential for catastrophic seam failure).

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Safety Factors for Glass vs. Acrylic]**
   - Location: Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables
   - Problem: Lacks quantitative safety factors for thickness.
   - Suggested fix: Add industry-standard safety factors: Glass (min 3.8 for rimless) vs. Acrylic (min 1.5-2.0 to prevent excessive deflection/bowing).
2. **[Bowing/Deflection Mechanics]**
   - Location: Key Concepts
   - Problem: Acrylic's tendency to bow (deflect) under hydrostatic pressure is mentioned but not explained.
   - Suggested fix: Explain that deflection increases with the square of height, requiring significantly thicker panels for taller acrylic tanks compared to glass.
3. **[UV Stability of Cell-Cast]**
   - Location: Safety Considerations
   - Problem: Yellowing risk is mentioned but doesn't distinguish between high-quality cell-cast and cheaper grades.
   - Suggested fix: Specify that high-quality Cell-Cast acrylic contains UV stabilizers that protect against yellowing for 10+ years even under reef-intense LED/Halide spectrums.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Include brand names for low-iron glass (Starphire, Optiwhite).
- Note that "molecular welding" in acrylic is essentially a single piece of material once cured, whereas glass joints are two materials (glass/silicone).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS (with minor additions)
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** The content is good but requires specific engineering metrics (safety factors, silicone types) to be truly reliable for a knowledge base that informs construction decisions.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Mandate acid-cure silicone for glass joints.
2. Add Safety Factor table (Glass 3.8 / Acrylic 2.0).
3. Elaborate on deflection/bowing scaling with tank height.
4. Update navigation and brand names.
