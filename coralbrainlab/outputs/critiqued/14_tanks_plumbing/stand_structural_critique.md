# Critique Report: Stand Structural Engineering

## Safety Audit: PASS

- TIER 1 Floor Loading consultation mandate (125gal+) is appropriate and safety-critical.
- MDF prohibition is correctly classified as a high-priority constraint (Physics-based failure).
- Leveling tolerances included.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is excellent. It connects biological stability (seam integrity) to structural engineering principles. The distinction between perimeter and surface support is technically accurate and crucial for the target audience.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Galvanic Corrosion]**
   - Location: Practical Application (Aluminum)
   - Problem: While aluminum is corrosion-resistant, the use of **stainless steel fasteners** in an aluminum T-slot frame can cause galvanic corrosion if saltwater is present, leading to "seizing" or joint failure.
   - Suggested fix: Mention the importance of using zinc-plated or specialized fasteners, or applying an anti-seize/barrier compound in high-spray areas.
2. **[Shim Placement]**
   - Location: Practical Application (Leveling)
   - Problem: The extraction says "Shim under the stand's footprint". It should explicitly warn AGAINST shimming between the tank and the stand (which creates a localized pressure point).
   - Suggested fix: Add a specific "NEVER SHIM" warning for the tank-to-stand interface.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention "Marine Grade Plywood" over standard CDX for better rot resistance.
- Add a note about "Cipping" or "Overhang" - the risk of edges of a tank hanging over a stand frame.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Technically sound and high-quality extraction. Minor additions regarding galvanic corrosion and shimming will reach the 10/10 mark.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Explicitly forbid shimming between tank and stand.
2. Address galvanic corrosion for aluminum frames.
3. Update specific plywood recommendations (Marine Grade).
