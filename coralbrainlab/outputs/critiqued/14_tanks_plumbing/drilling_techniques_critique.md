# Critique Report: Drilling Techniques

## Safety Audit: PASS

- TIER 1 Tempered glass warning is mandatory and well-placed.
- Eye protection and GFCI requirements are correctly identified.
- Edge distance constraints are present.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is comprehensive and technically accurate. It provides a solid bridge between DIY hobbyist methods and industrial engineering standards.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Edge Distance Accuracy]**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Hole Placement Standards
   - Problem: The text says "center of the hole... 2x the hole diameter". While safe, it is extremely restrictive and might prevent standard overflow placement. Industry standards (ASTM/GANA) typically specify distance from the **edge of the hole** to the **edge of the glass** based on **glass thickness**.
   - Suggested fix: Update to: "Distance from the edge of the hole to the glass edge should be at least **2x the glass thickness** or **1/2 the hole diameter**, whichever is greater." This is a safer and more common engineering metric.
2. **[Tape on Exit Side]**
   - Location: Practical Application (Glass)
   - Problem: Mention of "scrap wood" for support is good, but masking tape on the exit side is a more common and effective "quick fix" to prevent "blowout" chips.
   - Suggested fix: Add a recommendation to apply masking tape to the exit side of the hole.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention "Standardised Bulkhead Sizes" vs. Hole Saw sizes explicitly (e.g., 1" Bulkhead requires a 45mm saw). 
- Note that "Annealed" glass can be "Heat-Strengthened" (not same as tempered) and still drilled, though rarer in the hobby.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Technically sound and high-quality. Correcting the edge distance metric and adding the "tape trick" will reach the 10/10 mark.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Refine edge distance constraint (2x thickness vs 1/2 diameter).
2. Add masking tape exit-side trick.
3. Clarify bulkhead-to-saw size mapping.
