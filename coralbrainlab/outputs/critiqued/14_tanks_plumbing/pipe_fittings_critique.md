# Critique Report: PVC Types & Fittings

## Safety Audit: PASS

- TIER 1 NSF-61 certification requirement is crucial for preventing plasticizer leaching.
- Metal prohibition is correctly flagged as an absolute constraint.
- Cure time warning (24-48h) aligns with conservative safety standards.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is high quality and provides a clear distinction between the "WHY" (stagnant zones, head loss) and the "HOW" (Fitting selection, welding). The inclusion of specific ASTM standards adds credibility.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Solvent Trapping in Manifolds]**
   - Location: Practical Application (Solvent Welding)
   - Problem: When welding complex manifolds, solvent vapors can get "trapped" in dead-end sections of the pipe. If not purged, these vapors can dissolve the PVC from the inside or be released into the tank as a toxic surge upon startup.
   - Suggested fix: Recommend "purging" pipes with air (fan or vacuum) after welding especially for complex manifolds.
2. **[Thread Sealing (Tapered vs. Straight)]**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Practical Application
   - Problem: Extraction doesn't distinguish between NPT (tapered) and straight threads. Over-tightening NPT fittings into PVC bodies is a leading cause of cracked valves and bulkheads.
   - Suggested fix: Warn against over-tightening tapered threads and recommend T-Plus-2 or PTFE tape usage.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention "Barbed Fittings" for soft tubing transitions and the necessity of plastic ratcheting clamps (no metal worm gear clamps).
- Briefly explain the "1/4 turn" technique during welding more explicitly.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Technically accurate and comprehensive. Adding the thread sealing and solvent purging notes will make it perfect for reef applications.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add NPT thread sealing warning (over-tightening).
2. Add solvent vapor purging for complex manifolds.
3. Include barbed/soft tubing transition safety (plastic clamps only).
