# Critique Report: Bulkheads & Sealing

## Safety Audit: PASS

- TIER 1 Gasket placement rule is correctly emphasized.
- Plumbing support mandate is present.
- Warning on overtightening is clear and scientifically supported.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is precise and addresses the most common failure modes in aquarium plumbing. The distinction between ABS and Sch 80 is well-defined, and the hole saw chart provides immediate practical value.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Gasket Orientation]**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Installation
   - Problem: Some gaskets have a "ribbed" or "textured" side. The extraction doesn't specify which side should face the tank vs. the flange.
   - Suggested fix: Specify that if a gasket has one smooth side and one ribbed side, the **ribbed side** should typically face the flange (to grip it) while the smooth side faces the glass (to seal it), or follow manufacturer markings.
2. **[Slip vs. Threaded Differences]**
   - Location: Key Concepts
   - Problem: The extraction primarily discusses the bulkhead installation but doesn't mention the risks of "Slip" bulkheads (solvent welding inside the bulkhead body) vs "Threaded" bulkheads (removable).
   - Suggested fix: Note that Slip bulkheads are permanent once welded, whereas Threaded bulkheads allow for reconfiguration but carry a higher leak risk at the threads.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention "External Threading" on the nut side - many users try to plumb into the nut threads which are not tapered and won't seal correctly.
- Add a note on "Glass vs. Acrylic" thickness - thinner acrylic may deflect more, potentially requiring a wider flange or Sch 80 bulkhead for better load spreads.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Technically accurate and comprehensive. Adding the gasket orientation and slip/threaded distinction will make it industry-leading.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Address Gasket Orientation (Smooth vs. Ribbed).
2. Distinguish between Slip and Threaded bulkheads.
3. Warn against plumbing into the bulkhead nut threads.
