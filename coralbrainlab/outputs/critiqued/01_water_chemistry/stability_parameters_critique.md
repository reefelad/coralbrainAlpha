# Critique Report: Stability Parameters

## Safety Audit: PASS
*   Lethal heat/cold/salinity limits explicitly stated (Tier 1).
*   Heater failure mode addressed (Tier 2 Default: Redundancy).
*   ATO requirement emphasized.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The distinction between "Fuel" (Elements) and "Operating Conditions" (Stability) is a crucial mental model for users. Safety warnings regarding heater failure are practical and vital.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **Structure**
    *   Missing Navigation footer.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
1.  **Refugium Reverse Daylight**
    *   While correct for pH, perhaps clarify that this stabilizes the *night-time* drop specifically.

## Verification Checklist
