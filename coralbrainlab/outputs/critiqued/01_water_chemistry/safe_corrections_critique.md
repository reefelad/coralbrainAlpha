# Critique Report: Safe Correction Methods

## Safety Audit: PASS
Document strictly adheres to TIER 1 and TIER 2 safety constraints. The emphasis on "Stability over Numbers" is well-integrated.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
A very strong extraction that covers the most critical aspects of reef chemistry management. The "Safety Triangle" concept is a useful framing device. The document correctly identifies the biological reasoning behind the "speed limit" of corrections.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **[Issue]** Carbonate vs. Bicarbonate pH Impact.
    - Location: Practical Application > Correcting Low Alkalinity.
    - Problem: Different alkalinity additives have vastly different impacts on pH. Using Sodium Carbonate (Soda Ash) during a large correction can cause a localized pH spike >8.6, causing stress.
    - Suggested fix: Add a note about choosing the correct buffer (Bicarbonate vs Carbonate) based on current pH levels and the size of the correction.
2.  **[Issue]** Precipitation Risk (The Time Gap).
    - Location: Key Concepts > The Safety Triangle.
    - Problem: If Calcium and Alkalinity corrections are performed at the same time in the same location, they will likely precipitate into Calcium Carbonate, making the correction ineffective and potentially coating equipment in "sand."
    - Suggested fix: Explicitly mention the requirement for a time gap (e.g., 10–30 minutes) between adding different major elements.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention "Reference Solutions" specifically in the safety check as the preferred way to verify a test kit before acting — Safety Considerations.
- Briefly mention "Slurry Dosing" (mixing powder with RO/DI before adding) as part of the "Density/Concentration" safety factor — Key Concepts.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is safe and accurate. Addressing the pH impact and precipitation risk will make it a "perfect" guide for reefkeepers performing manual chemistry adjustments.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add the "Time Gap" requirement for dosing Major Elements.
2. Differentiate between Carbonate and Bicarbonate pH impacts during correction.
3. Include "Reference Solutions" in the verification protocol.
