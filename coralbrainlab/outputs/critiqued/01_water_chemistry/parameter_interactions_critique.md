# Critique Report: Parameter Interactions

## Safety Audit: PASS
*   Ammonia toxicity relation to pH correctly identified (Tier 1 Constraint).
*   Hypoxia risk from temperature spikes addressed.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The "Reef is not a spreadsheet" analogy is perfect for this domain. Dissects the complex relationships (Alk/pH, Temp/Oxygen) simply and effectively.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **Structure**
    *   Missing Navigation footer.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
1.  **Practical Application**
    *   Could expanded on "Magnesium is the referee" slightly more to explain *how* it allows higher levels (ion pairing), but the current explanation is sufficient for the layman.

## Verification Checklist
*   [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
*   [x] Triton alignment: PASS
*   [x] Source quality: PASS
*   [x] Discovery First: PASS
*   [x] Completeness: PASS
*   [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing Nav)

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Excellent synthesis. Just needs Navigation.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1.  Add Navigation.
