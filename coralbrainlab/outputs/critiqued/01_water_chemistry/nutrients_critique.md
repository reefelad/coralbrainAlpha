# Critique Report: Nutrients (NO3/PO4)

## Safety Audit: PASS
*   Explicit warning against Zero Phosphate (Tier 1 constraint implicit in "Lethal range").
*   Warning against rapid reduction included.
*   Ranges aligned with safe reefkeeping practices.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
Strong conceptual overview distinguishing between "pollutant" and "nutrient". The biological context of zooxanthellae "rent" is excellent Discovery First language. Matches Triton methodology perfectly.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **Structure / Template Compliance**
    *   Location: End of file
    *   Problem: Missing "## Navigation" section.
    *   Suggested fix: Add standardized navigation footer.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
1.  **Clarity on "Green Film Algae"**
    *   Location: Troubleshooting
    *   Issue: Valid point, but clarify that this is distinct from *nuisance* hair algae. Use "soft green film on glass" to be specific.

## Verification Checklist
*   [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
*   [x] Triton alignment: PASS
*   [x] Source quality: PASS
*   [x] Discovery First: PASS
*   [x] Completeness: PASS
*   [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing Navigation)

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Safe, accurate, and conceptually sound. Navigation is the only missing structural element.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1.  Add Navigation section.
2.  Clarify "Green Film Algae" description.
