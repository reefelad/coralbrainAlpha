# Critique Report: Major Elements (Alk/Ca/Mg)

## Safety Audit: PASS
*   Max Alk change limits correctly stated (2.0 dKH absolute / 1.0 dKH default).
*   Precipitation warnings included (Triton tier 1 constraint implicitly handled by warning against simultaneous dosing).
*   No lethal ranges recommended.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
Excellent "Discovery First" explanation of the calcification process. The analogy of the "construction site" is effective. Source tiering is correctly applied. Safety constraints are prominent. The only missing element is the Navigation footer required by the template.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **Structure / Template Compliance**
    *   Location: End of file
    *   Problem: Missing "## Navigation" section as per Domain Structure Template.
    *   Suggested fix: Add standardized navigation footer linking to Index and next subdomain (Nutrients).

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
1.  **Formatting**
    *   Location: Parameter Ranges Table
    *   Issue: "Safety Low" and "Safety High" columns are useful but ensure distinct clarity between "Triton Rec" and "Safety Limits". (Current format is acceptable/good).

## Verification Checklist
*   [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
*   [x] Triton alignment: PASS
*   [x] Source quality: PASS
*   [x] Discovery First: PASS
*   [x] Completeness: PASS (except Nav)
*   [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing Navigation)

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is safe, scientifically accurate, and aligns perfectly with Triton methodology. The missing navigation footer is a minor structural oversight easily fixed in refinement.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1.  Add "## Navigation" section.
2.  Ensure verified status is maintained.
