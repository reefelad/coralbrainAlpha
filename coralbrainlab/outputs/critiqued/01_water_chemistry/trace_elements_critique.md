# Critique Report: Trace Elements

## Safety Audit: PASS
*   Copper toxicity explicitly warned (Tier 1 Constraint).
*   Correct distinction between therapeutic levels for fish vs lethal levels for corals.
*   Iodine overdose warning included.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The "spark plug" analogy is very effective for explaining the role of trace elements to laypeople. Strong emphasis on the "Don't Guess, Test" philosophy which is central to modern reefkeeping.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **Structure / Template Compliance**
    *   Location: End of file
    *   Problem: Missing "## Navigation" section.
    *   Suggested fix: Add standardized navigation footer.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
1.  **Terminology Precision**
    *   Location: Halogens
    *   Issue: "Preserves the ratio with Chlorine" for Bromine is a bit vague. Maybe clarify "Bromine is part of the Halogen group/ratio with Chloride/Fluoride/Iodide". But "Ratio with Chlorine" is acceptable for general understanding.

## Verification Checklist
*   [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
*   [x] Triton alignment: PASS
*   [x] Source quality: PASS
*   [x] Discovery First: PASS
*   [x] Completeness: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1.  Add Navigation section.
