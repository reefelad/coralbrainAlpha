# Critique Report: ACTIVE COOLING & VENTILATION

## Safety Audit: PASS
Tier 1 limits (20-32°C) are clearly stated. The critical link between evaporative cooling and salinity stability (ATO requirement) is correctly identified as a Tier 1 constraint.

## Quality Score: 8.5/10

## Summary
The document provides a solid technical foundation for aquarium cooling. The physical explanation of evaporative cooling is accurate and the distinction between active and passive methods is clear.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Fixture Cooling vs. Tank Cooling** 
   - Location: Overview / Key Concepts
   - Problem: The document focuses on cooling the water, but "cooling and ventilation" in the context of `16_lighting_systems` should also include the cooling requirements of the lighting fixtures themselves (internal fans, heat sinks).
   - Suggested fix: Add a section on "Fixture-Level Cooling" and how internal fixture fans prevent LED diode degradation and thermal drift.

2. **Room Humidity and Structural Impact**
   - Location: Ambient Ventilation
   - Problem: While humidity's impact on cooling is mentioned, the structural impact of humidity (mold, drywall rot) in the reef room is a significant "Discovery First" safety point for the home/facility.
   - Suggested fix: Add a brief note on the importance of "Exhaust Fans" for humidity management to protect the building structure.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Short Cycling — Location: Safety Considerations — Could explicitly state that short-cycling is defined as more than 4-6 starts per hour for most compressors.
- Chiller Sizing — A simple "Rule of Thumb" for chiller sizing (HP vs tank volume) would be a valuable Practical Application addition.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** High quality content that only needs minor expansions to bridge the gap between "water cooling" and the "lighting system hardware cooling" that the domain implies.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add content on fixture-level cooling (internal fixture fans/heat sinks).
2. Expand ventilation section to include structural humidity management (mold/rot prevention).
3. Include chiller sizing guidelines or rules of thumb.
