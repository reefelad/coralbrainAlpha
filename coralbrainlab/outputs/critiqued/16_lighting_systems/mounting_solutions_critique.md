# Critique Report: MOUNTING SOLUTIONS

## Safety Audit: PASS
No Tier 1 violations found. The document correctly emphasizes weight limits, drowning hazards (fixture falling), and the absolute requirement for drip loops.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The generator has produced a high-quality, comprehensive overview of reef aquarium mounting solutions. The "Discovery First" principles are well-applied, explaining the physical rationale behind mounting height before the technical implementations.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Light Spill Management**
   - Location: Practical Application / Key Concepts
   - Problem: While height is discussed for coverage, the negative impact of "light spill" (glare in the room, efficiency loss) is mentioned in research but absent from the raw output.
   - Suggested fix: Add a brief section on managing light spill, perhaps mentioning "light shades" or "diffusers" as part of the mounting solution ecosystem.

2. **Cooling and Clearance**
   - Location: Safety Considerations
   - Problem: Mentions thermal clearance but could be more explicit about "active cooling" vs "passive cooling" fixtures and how mounting in an enclosure (canopy) vs open-top changes the safety requirements.
   - Suggested fix: Add a note about the dangers of "trapped heat" in canopy-style mounting.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Vibration mention — Location: Key Concepts — Could specify that long rail systems are more prone to harmonic vibration than short tank-mount arms.
- Euro-bracing — Mentioned in Overview but could use a specific "Practical Application" note since euro-bracing is a common source of mounting compatibility failure.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is structurally sound, safe, and biologically/physically grounded. The issues identified are refinements rather than corrections of errors.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Incorporate light spill management considerations.
2. Elaborate on thermal safety for enclosed (canopy) mounting versus open-top.
3. Add specific guidance for euro-bracing compatibility.
