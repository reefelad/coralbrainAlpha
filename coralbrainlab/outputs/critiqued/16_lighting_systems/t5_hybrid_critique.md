# Critique Report: T5 & Hybrid Lighting Systems

## Safety Audit: PASS
- **TIER 1 Compliance:** Addresses the Mercury hazard and UV leakage, which are the primary TIER 1 risks for gas-discharge lamps.
- **Acclimation Safety:** Staggered bulb replacement is correctly identified as a safety default to prevent light shock.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content provides a very clear explanation of the physics of diffused light and why it matters biologically (Shadow Debt). It effectively addresses the "Active Cooling" aspect which is often misunderstood in T5 systems.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Refugium Application (Triton Specific):**
   - Location: Practical Application / Overview
   - Problem: Triton Lab specifically recommends T5 for refugiums (50/50 Blue/White mix) over many LEDs due to the broader spectrum. This should be explicitly mentioned to align with the Triton Methodology baseline.
   - Suggested fix: Add a specific section or note about T5s being the "Triton Preferred" method for high-efficiency macroalgae growth.
2. **"Cold Spot" Technical Accuracy:**
   - Location: Key Concepts
   - Problem: The "cold spot" (the coldest part of the lamp) is technically where the mercury condenses. The fan should be oriented to cool this specific spot (usually the side of the lamp with the label).
   - Suggested fix: Add a brief technical note about the importance of fan orientation relative to the lamp's "cold spot" (marked by the label on most major brands like ATI).

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Navigation: Ensure the "Next" link `mounting_solutions.md` matches the skeleton (which says `mounting_solutions`).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** High quality and accurate. The inclusion of the "Shadow Debt" concept is excellent Discovery First writing. Strengthening the Refugium/Triton connection will make this perfect.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Integrate the Triton refugium-T5 recommendation.
2. Add the "Cold Spot" orientation detail for T5 maintenance.
3. Clean up navigation links.
