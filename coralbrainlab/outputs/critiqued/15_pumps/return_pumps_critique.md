# Critique Report: Return Pumps

## Safety Audit: PASS

- TIER 1 Run-dry protection requirement is critical for fire safety.
- Material safety (ceramic shafts) is correctly identified to prevent heavy metal leaching.
- GFCI interface is mentioned.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is excellent and provides a strong technical foundation for the pumping system. It correctly identifies the "heart" analogy and prioritizes biological turnover over mere mechanical specs.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Refugium Velocity Nuance]**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Triton 10x Mandate
   - Problem: The extraction states 10x system volume turnover. It should clarify that this is specifically tied to the **Refugium intake velocity**. If a system bypasses the refugium or has a remote refugium, the 10x rule might apply differently.
   - Suggested fix: Clarify that the 10x turnover is designed to optimize nutrient uptake in the macroalgae section of the sump.
2. **[Check Valve Warning]**
   - Location: Practical Application or Safety
   - Problem: While mentioned in `pipe_fittings`, the return pump is where people most often install check valves. These are prone to 100% failure in reef tanks due to calcification or snail shells.
   - Suggested fix: Reiterate the warning against check valves and promote **siphon breaks** (air holes) or **sump volume buffer** as the TIER 1 safety method for back-siphon management.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention "External vs. Internal" mounting. External mounting removes pump heat from the water but introduces leak risk. Internal is 100% leak-safe but adds thermal load.
- Briefly mention "Pressure Rated" pumps (for high-pressure reactors or needle-wheel skimmers) vs. "Flow Rated" pumps.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Technically accurate and very well structured. Adding the refugium nuance and the check-valve safety warning specific to return pumps will solidify the content.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Refine the 10x mandate to link specifically to refugium performance.
2. Add the back-siphon safety section (Siphon breaks vs. Check valves).
3. Distinguish between internal and external mounting trade-offs.
