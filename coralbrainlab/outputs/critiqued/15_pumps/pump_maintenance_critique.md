# Critique Report: Pump Maintenance & Calibration

## Safety Audit: PASS

- TIER 1 Ceramic fragility warning is mandatory for preventing mechanical failure.
- TIER 1 Magnet damage warning is correctly linked to heavy metal leaching.
- Use of Citric Acid for food-grade safety and material compatibility is highlighted.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is a masterclass in reef equipment maintenance. It avoids the common mistake of recommending vinegar and provides a scientifically sound rationale for the "Calcification Cycle" in motor blocks.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Dosing Placement Prevention]**
   - Location: Practical Application or Key Concepts
   - Problem: The best way to maintain a pump is to prevent buildup in the first place. Dosing Alkalinity or Kalkwasser near a pump intake causes immediate localized precipitation.
   - Suggested fix: Recommend that all chemical dosing (Alk/Ca/Mg) occurs downstream of the return pump intake or in a high-flow area of the sump to minimize "pump-side" scaling.
2. **[Impeller Orientation]**
   - Location: Practical Application (Maintenance Protocol)
   - Problem: Some DC pumps have directional impellers or specific ceramic bushings that must be oriented correctly. Reversing them can cause immediate internal scoring.
   - Suggested fix: Add a note to record or photograph the impeller orientation during disassembly.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention "Pump Watts" as a diagnostic tool - if a pump is drawing more power than rated, it is likely fighting friction/buildup.
- Note the importance of cleaning the "Pump Cage" or intake screen to prevent cavitational stress on the impeller.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Technically accurate and comprehensive. Adding the preventative dosing placement and the "Wattage diagnostic" tip will provide additional value to advanced reefers.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add Dosing Placement guidance for prevention.
2. Include Wattage/Power Draw as a maintenance diagnostic.
3. Advise on intake screen/cage cleaning.
