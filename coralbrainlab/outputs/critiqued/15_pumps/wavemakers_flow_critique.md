# Critique Report: Wavemakers & In-Tank Flow

## Safety Audit: PASS

- TIER 1 Tissue stripping warning is vital.
- TIER 1 Magnetic integrity (heavy metal leaching) is correctly identified.
- Drip loops are mentioned (correctly upgraded to TIER 1 as it's a fire/shock hazard).

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw extraction is technically sophisticated and effectively links fluid dynamics to coral physiology (DBL reduction). It provides actionable advice that balances biological needs with mechanical safety.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Anemone/Snail Intake Safety]**
   - Location: Safety Considerations
   - Problem: Wavemakers are the #1 killer of *Entacmaea quadricolor* (Bubble Tip Anemones) and large *Turbo* snails. The extraction mentions "Fish Guards" but doesn't emphasize why this is a critical TIER 1/2 safety step for specific livestock.
   - Suggested fix: Add a specific warning about "Walk-in" hazards for anemones and recommend 3D-printed guards or specialized mesh for reef systems containing wandering invertebrates.
2. **[Shimmer vs. Disco Effect]**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Overview
   - Problem: Flow doesn't just move water; it creates the "shimmer" effect by acting as a liquid lens for the lights. High surface agitation can also create "disco" (multi-colored spotting) with certain LED fixtures.
   - Suggested fix: Briefly mention the optical interaction between surface flow and the "Shimmer Effect."

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention "Battery Backup" more prominently as a life-support requirement for wavemakers specifically (oxygenation stops within minutes of power loss in high-stocking tanks).
- Note that Gyre pumps require more frequent cleaning than propeller pumps because their small fins are more sensitive to biofilm/calcification.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** High quality and accurate. Incorporating the anemone safety and shimmer nuances will make it a 10/10.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Address Invertebrate Intake hazards (Anemones/Snails).
2. Link surface flow to optical Shimmer and Oxygenation.
3. Mention Battery Backup as a Wavemaker-specific priority.
