# Critique Report: Photoperiod & Light Cycles

## Safety Audit: PASS
Document includes critical absolute safety limits for maximum light duration and minimum dark periods. No violations of biological safety standards.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The document provides a comprehensive and accurate overview of the biological rhythms that drive a reef system. The "Discovery First" approach in the overview and the focus on the dark period as restorative are excellent. The "1-8-1 Model" is an actionable and safe recommendation.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **[Issue]** Chemical Demand and Photoperiod.
    - Location: Practical Application > Using Photoperiod for Nutrient Management.
    - Problem: Changing the photoperiod length has a massive impact on daily Alkalinity and Calcium consumption. Increasing the day length by 1 hour can increase daily dosing requirements by 10-15%.
    - Suggested fix: Add a warning that any change to photoperiod length must be accompanied by increased frequency of chemistry testing (Alk) to adjust dosing accordingly.
2.  **[Issue]** Spectral Impact of Moonlight.
    - Location: Key Concepts > Lunar Cycles.
    - Problem: It mentions intensity (<1 PAR) but not the spectrum. "White" moonlight or full-spectrum moonlight at night can stimulate algae growth and disrupt fish sleep cycles more than a dim, blue-shifted (450nm) moonlight.
    - Suggested fix: Recommend a monochromatic deep blue (450-465nm) or shifted violet spectrum for moonlights to minimize biological disruption.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Briefly mention "Seasonal Simulation" (adjusting±30 mins over 6 months) for advanced spawning-focused systems — Gaps or Practical Application.
- Clarify the "Siesta" period origins (heat management for Halides) to provide context for the Gap — Gaps / Open Questions.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is accurate, safe, and provides high-quality guidance. Addressing the chemical demand link and the moonlight spectrum will make it a more robust technical resource.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Explicitly link photoperiod duration to chemical (Alk) consumption rates.
2. Recommend monochromatic blue for moonlight cycles to minimize disruption.
3. Provide context for the "Siesta" period as a legacy heat-management technique.
