# Critique Report: Fixture Types & Technologies

## Safety Audit: PASS
- No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations identified. 
- Electrical safety (GFC) and UV shielding correctly highlighted as absolute/default constraints.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The extraction is highly accurate and adheres well to the Discovery First principle by explaining the physics of light delivery (point vs. linear sources). It correctly tiers its sources and maintains a neutral, scientific tone.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of document
   - Problem: Structural requirement for navigation footer is missing.
   - Suggested fix: Add `[Index] | [Next Subdomain]` or similar navigation markers typical for the project structure.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Metal Halide Detail** — Section: Key Concepts. While sun-like punch is mentioned, the specific biological benefit of high-intensity point sources for deep-water penetration could be slightly more explicit in Discovery First language.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: REVISE (Missing nav footer)

## Verdict: PASS
**Reasoning:** The content is excellent and safe. The minor structural omission (navigation footer) can be easily corrected by the Refiner.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add standard navigation footer/links.
2. Ensure consistent formatting of [TIER-X] tags (all look good currently).
3. Elaborate slightly on the "biological WHY" of high-intensity penetration in the Metal Halide section.
