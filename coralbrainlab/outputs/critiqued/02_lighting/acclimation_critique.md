# Critique Report: Light Acclimation Protocols

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations. The TIER 1 constraint regarding max PAR jumps (+50% max) is a critical safety addition that protects against RTN.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is technically robust and bridges the gap between biological theory and practical application (e.g., distinguishing between software acclimation and physical placement). The "Dark Start" section is a valuable inclusion for hobbyists receiving shipped corals.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: Bottom of document.
   - Problem: Lack of mandatory Navigation section.
   - Required fix: Add navigation links as per core template.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Clarification on "Mesenterial Filaments"**
   - Location: Signs of Light Stress
   - Problem: While accurate as a stress sign, filaments are more commonly associated with feeding or aggression. In the context of light, it's a "severe" stress sign.
   - Suggested fix: Clarify that filaments represent extreme environmental shock, often preceding tissue loss.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Suggest adding a note about "Photo-period reduction" being less effective than "Intensity reduction" for modern LEDs due to spectrum consistency.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing navigation)

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** Technically excellent but structurally incomplete due to missing navigation. Minor refinement on stress signs will improve clarity.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Append Navigation section.
2. Refine the description of mesenterial filaments to emphasize extreme shock.
3. Ensure "Sandbed Buffering" is clearly defined as a primary TIER 2 recommendation.
