# Critique Report: PAR & Spectrum Fundamentals

## Safety Audit: PASS
Document includes vital safety constraints regarding the velocity of light intensity changes (10-15% per week) and UV safety. No violations of biological limits.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
A scientifically robust extraction that correctly identifies the link between lighting and system-wide metabolism. The "Discovery First" approach in the overview is well-implemented. The document effectively breaks down the complex topic of pigments into actionable information.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **[Issue]** The biological "Why" of Photo-acclimation.
    - Location: Key Concepts or Overview.
    - Problem: It explains *what* happens (browning or bleaching) but doesn't explicitly name the process of **photo-acclimation** where corals adjust the density of zooxanthellae or the concentration of light-harvesting pigments.
    - Suggested fix: Add a brief explanation of photo-acclimation as the mechanism corals use to adapt to changing light levels over days and weeks.
2.  **[Issue]** Red Light and Nuisance Algae.
    - Location: Practical Application > Reading Spectrum Charts.
    - Problem: It mentions avoiding yellow/green light for human appeal, but red light (630–700nm) is highly utilized by nuisance Cyanobacteria and filamentous algae, which can outcompete corals in nutrient-rich environments.
    - Suggested fix: Explicitly link high red-spectrum spikes to increased risk of nuisance algae growth in the practical application section.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Mention that fluorescent proteins (the "glow" under blue light) often serve a biological purpose, such as re-emitting harmful high-energy light as safer lower-energy light or concentrating light for zooxanthellae in deep water — Key Concepts.
- Clarify that PAR meters are least accurate at the extreme violet/UV end of the spectrum (the "PAR meter error" at 400nm) — Practical Application.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is accurate and safe. Minor refinements in the biological "why" of acclimation and the impact of the red spectrum will enhance its value for decision support.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Define and explain the biological mechanism of **Photo-acclimation**.
2. Document the link between the Red Spectrum and nuisance algae growth.
3. Note the fluorescent protein role in light management.
