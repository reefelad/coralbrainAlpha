# Critique Report: Mounting & Placement

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations detected. The 4-inch minimum height for salt creep prevention is an excellent and accurate inclusion.

## Quality Score: 8/10

## Summary
The extraction is comprehensive and accurately reflects current industry standards for high-end reef lighting. The "Discovery First" approach in the Overview is particularly strong, explaining the three-dimensional impact of light distribution on coral health.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: Bottom of document.
   - Problem: The document lacks the mandatory Navigation section specified in the Domain Structure Template.
   - Required fix: Add navigation links to CoralBrainLab Index, Skeleton, and Next subdomain.
   - Safety impact: None (Structural only).

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Missing Parameter Table for AI Hydra 32/64**
   - Location: Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables
   - Problem: While mentioned in Practical Application, the Hydra series (one of the most common) is missing from the summary table.
   - Suggested fix: Add AI Hydra 32/64 to the reference table with its 12"-14" mounting height recommendation.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Formatting — "Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables" header could be more concise, but matches template.
- Source citation overlap — Some brand info counts as both Manufacturer (TIER-1) and BRS tested (TIER-2). Clarifying the primary source in the table would be beneficial.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing navigation)

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** The content is technically excellent, but the structural omission of the navigation footer and the absence of AI Hydra in the reference table need to be addressed before compilation.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Append the mandatory Navigation section.
2. Update the Reference Table to include AI Hydra series.
3. Ensure consistent brand capitalization throughout.
