# Critique Report: Coral-Specific Light Requirements

## Safety Audit: PASS
- No TIER 1 violations found.
- Maximum PAR limit (700) correctly identified to prevent photodamage.
- Acclimation protocol (50% reduction / 14 days) aligns with conservative safety practices.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is comprehensive, scientifically accurate, and adheres well to the "Discovery First" principle. It correctly identifies the biological relationship between corals and zooxanthellae. Source tiering is appropriately applied, and specific Triton-related guidance is included.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: Bottom of file.
   - Problem: The output follows the Generator template but lacks the Navigation section required by the Core Structure.
   - Required fix: Add the standard navigation block with links to the Index and the Skeleton.
2. **Specific Source Citation for PSP**
   - Location: Key Concepts > Photosynthetic Saturation Point
   - Problem: Cites "Falkowski et al." generally.
   - Suggested fix: If possible, cite a more specific paper title or year to move it from a generic [TIER-1] to a verified specific reference.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Triton Methodology for Display** — Location: Practical Application. While the refugium advice is clear, Triton's display preference for full-spectrum over "hyper-blue" settings (to ensure balanced trace element consumption) could be more explicitly stated.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: REVISE (Missing Navigation)

## Verdict: PASS
**Reasoning:** The content is high quality and safe. The missing navigation footer is a structural requirement that the Refiner can easily rectify. Factual content is solid.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add mandatory Navigation footer as per `coralbrainlab-core`.
2. Explicitly link the relationship between high light and nutrient levels (NP ratio) to prevent tissue starvation.
3. Include the Triton display lighting preference for balanced spectrum vs blue-heavy peaks for trace element absorption.
