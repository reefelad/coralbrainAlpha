# Critique Report: ELECTRICAL SAFETY

## Safety Audit: [PASS]
- GFCI requirement is central and correctly cited as a TIER 1 absolute.
- Grounding probe usage correctly tied to GFCI presence.
- Static voltage vs. human life safety balance is correctly prioritised.

## Quality Score: [9.5/10]

## Summary
This is an excellent extraction. It addresses the most critical life-safety aspects of reef-keeping with high technical accuracy. The "Discovery First" overview is particularly strong, explaining the conductive nature of saltwater before diving into the hardware.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Equipment Placement specificity**
   - Location: Practical Application > Safe Layout
   - Problem: While it mentioned a "dry compartment," it didn't explicitly warn against mounting power strips *behind* or *directly under* the aquarium where a bulkhead leak could spray directly into the electronics.
   - Suggested fix: Add a specific warning about the "spray path" from potential plumbing failures.

2. **Grounding Probe Connection**
   - Location: Key Concepts > Grounding Probes
   - Problem: It says "connected to the electrical ground," but some hobbyists mistakenly connect them to a cold water pipe or other non-electrical ground.
   - Suggested fix: Emphasize that it MUST be connected to the dedicated ground pin of a 3-prong outlet for the GFCI to function as intended.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Heater Failure Mode] — [Overview]: Mentioning that glass heaters are the most common source of stray voltage due to thermal shock/cracking.
- [Titanium vs. Stainless] — [Parameter Ranges]: Clarifying that 316 Stainless is "acceptable" but Titanium is "ideal" for long-term saltwater submersion due to corrosion resistance.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: [PASS]
- [x] Triton alignment: [PASS]
- [x] Source quality: [PASS]
- [x] Discovery First: [PASS]
- [x] Completeness: [PASS]
- [x] Structure: [PASS]

## Verdict: [PASS]

**Reasoning:** Technically accurate and safe. The suggested improvements will provide extra layers of practical safety for the end-user.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Emphasize correct electrical ground connection (3rd pin) for probes.
2. Add specific warning about "spray paths" from plumbing leaks near electronics.
3. Highlight glass heater cracks as a primary source of grounding intervention.
