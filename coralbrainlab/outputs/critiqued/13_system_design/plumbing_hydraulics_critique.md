# Critique Report: PLUMBING HYDRAULICS

## Safety Audit: [PASS]
- No TIER 1 safety violations found in vertical vertical/pressure recommendations.
- Non-toxic materials (PVC/Silicone) correctly highlighted as TIER 1.
- Siphon-break requirement correctly included as TIER 2.

## Quality Score: [9/10]

## Summary
The extraction is comprehensive and accurately reflects the physical principles of plumbing hydraulics in a reef context. It strongly supports the Triton Method's turnover requirements while providing practical advice on minimizing head pressure.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Vertical Rise vs. Static Head Detail**
   - Location: Key Concepts > Total Dynamic Head
   - Problem: While it mentioned elevation, it didn't explicitly warn that pump flow curves are often misleading if the user doesn't measure from the *sump water level* to the *top of the return line* (not just the height of the stand).
   - Suggested fix: Clarify the measurement points for Static Head for highest accuracy.

2. **Drain Side vs. Return Side Hydraulics**
   - Location: Overview / Key Concepts
   - Problem: The extraction focuses almost exclusively on the return side. While return is the active force, drain side hydraulics (gravity/siphon) are equally critical for the "Interfaces" and overall system design.
   - Suggested fix: Briefly mention the hydraulic difference between gravity-fed drains and pump-driven returns.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Burbing Pipes] — [Practical Application]: Mentioning the importance of removing air (burping) from the return line for maximum flow efficiency.
- [Flex Pipe vs. Hard Pipe] — [Practical Application]: Briefly comparing the friction loss of flexible PVC vs. rigid PVC (flex pipe is often smoother in bends but can have higher surface friction depending on the brand).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: [PASS]
- [x] Triton alignment: [PASS]
- [x] Source quality: [PASS]
- [x] Discovery First: [PASS]
- [x] Completeness: [PASS]
- [x] Structure: [PASS]

## Verdict: [PASS]

**Reasoning:** The content is technically sound and meets all structural requirements. The suggested fixes are for depth and clarity rather than correction of errors.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Explicitly clarify measurement points for Static Head (sump water level to highest return point).
2. Incorporate a brief section on drain-side hydraulic principles to balance the system view.
3. Compare flex vs. rigid pipe friction benefits.
