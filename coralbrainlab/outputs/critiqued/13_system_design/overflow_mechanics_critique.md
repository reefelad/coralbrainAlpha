# Critique Report: Overflow & Drain Mechanics (Herbie/Bean)

## Safety Audit: PASS
- Sump capacity for power outages correctly identified as a TIER 1 constraint.
- Siphon break requirement (no reliance on check valves) is properly flagged as TIER 1.
- All biological and mechanical parameters align with conservative reef-keeping practices.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content provides a strong "Discovery First" foundation by explaining the biological importance of surface renewal. The distinction between the three main overflow types (Durso, Herbie, Bean Animal) is clear, and the technical mechanics of full siphons are accurately described. Redundancy and failsafes are appropriately prioritized.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Gate Valve vs. Ball Valve]**
   - Location: Practical Application / Tuning a Siphon System
   - Problem: While a gate valve is recommended, the critique should emphasize *why* (ball valves are too coarse for the precision needed to maintain a silent full siphon).
   - Required fix: Add a brief note on the lack of precision in ball valves for this application.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Clog prevention] — Safety Considerations: Add a minor note about checking drains regularly for salt creep or algae growth.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is technically sound and adheres to all structural and safety protocols. The minor clarification on valve types will significantly improve practical usability.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Elaborate on why gate valves are mandatory (precision tuning of the siphon).
2. Include a maintenance check for salt creep/algae in safety notes.
