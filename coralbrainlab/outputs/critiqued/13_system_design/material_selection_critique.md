# Critique Report: MATERIAL SELECTION

## Safety Audit: [PASS]
- Heavy metal exclusion (Copper/Lead/Zinc) correctly listed as TIER 1.
- Potable water/NSF-61 requirements correctly identified as TIER 1.
- Biocompatibility of plastics correctly tiered.

## Quality Score: [9/10]

## Summary
The extraction is high-quality and technically detailed. It correctly distinguishes between "safe for humans" (food grade) and "safe for coral" (biocompatible/inert). The inclusion of 3D printing specifics (PETG vs PLA/ABS) is highly relevant for modern reef-keeping.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Silicone Additives Specificity**
   - Location: Safety Considerations > TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS
   - Problem: It mentioned "anti-fungal additives" but didn't explicitly name common household brands or the specific additive "Triclosan" which is often hidden.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly name that any "mildew-resistant" silicone is a TIER 1 violation.

2. **Triton IPC ICP-OES Context**
   - Location: Overview / Discovery First
   - Problem: The Triton Method is famous for detecting these materials' failures via ICP-OES testing. This context is missing from the "Discovery First" section.
   - Suggested fix: Mention how the Triton Method uses ICP testing to identify when incorrect materials (like the wrong plumbing or magnets) are leaching metals.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Nylon Warning] — [Key Concepts]: Briefly mention that Nylon absorbs water and can swell, making it a poor choice for precision submerged parts regardless of chemical safety.
- [Magnet Enclosure] — [Practical Application]: Mention that low-quality magnets (pump impellers, frag racks) are a primary source of rust/iron leaching if the plastic seal is breached.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: [PASS]
- [x] Triton alignment: [PASS]
- [x] Source quality: [PASS]
- [x] Discovery First: [PASS]
- [x] Completeness: [PASS]
- [x] Structure: [PASS]

## Verdict: [PASS]

**Reasoning:** Technically sound and provides actionable safety advice. The suggested fixes will better align it with the specific Triton Method monitoring ecosystem (ICP testing).

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Explicitly warn against "mildew-resistant" silicone as a TIER 1 violation.
2. Link the importance of material selection to Triton ICP-OES testing (discovery of leaching).
3. Add a warning about magnet seal breaches (rusting).
