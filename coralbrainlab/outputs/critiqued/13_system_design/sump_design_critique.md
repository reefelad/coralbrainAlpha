# Critique Report: SUMP DESIGN

## Safety Audit: PASS
- No TIER 1 water chemistry violations.
- Flood prevention (back-siphon volume) is correctly identified as a TIER 1 absolute constraint.
- Electrical separation correctly identified as TIER 1.

## Quality Score: 8/10

## Summary
The raw content provides a solid foundation for sump design principles, specifically aligning well with the Triton Method's functional zoning. The "WHY" before "HOW" logic is present in the overview.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None identified that prevent a PASS verdict.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Baffle Spacing Specifics**
   - Location: Key Concepts > Baffle Mechanics
   - Problem: While "2-3 inches per second" is mentioned for velocity, standard physical spacing (e.g., 1-2 inches between baffles) for ease of cleaning is not mentioned.
   - Suggested fix: Add a note about cleaning access in the baffle section.

2. **Material Safety (Chemical Off-gassing)**
   - Location: Practical Application > Material Selection
   - Problem: Doesn't mention curing times for silicone in glass sumps or the risk of using non-aquarium-safe silicones (which contain anti-fungal agents toxic to reefs).
   - Suggested fix: Add a TIER 2 recommendation for using only 100% silicone (MSDS verified) and allowing 48-72 hours of curing.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Location: Interfaces — [Plumbing Hydraulics](plumbing_hydraulics.md) link is internal to the same domain but lacks the relative path prefix used in other links if this were to be moved. Actually, in raw it's just `plumbing_hydraulics.md`, which is fine for raw but should be checked during compilation.
- The term "craze" for acrylic could be briefly defined for beginners.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is technically accurate and follows the methodology. The issues identified are refinements rather than fundamental errors.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Include safety note on silicone selection and curing.
2. Add practical advice on baffle spacing for maintenance (cleaning access).
3. Briefly define acrylic "crazing".
