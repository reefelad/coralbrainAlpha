# Critique Report: dosing_principles

## Safety Audit: PASS
No Tier 1 safety violations found. Maximum daily alkalinity rise matches safe limits. Separation of additives is correctly emphasized.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw content is excellent. It correctly frames dosing not as a chore but as a biological necessity driven by calcification. The focus on stability and ionic balance aligns perfectly with Triton methodology. The explanation of "consumption-based dosing" is clear and authoritative.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None found.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Saturation/Precipitation Details**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Saturation and Precipitation
   - Problem: "There is a chemical limit to how much Calcium and Alkalinity can act exist in solution" - "can act exist" is a typo.
   - Suggested fix: Change to "can exist".
   - Also, could clarify that Magnesium plays a role in *preventing* precipitation by poisoning the calcite crystal lattice. This is a key "Why" for maintaining Magnesium.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Source Specificity:** Reference to "Reef calculator" could be more specific (e.g., specific reputable calculators or the math behind it).
- **Hyphens:** "Bio-availability" vs "Bioavailability".

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Strong foundational content that adheres to all safety and pedagogical constraints. Minor typos do not detract from the safety or accuracy.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Fix typo "can act exist".
2. Add sentence about Magnesium's role in inhibiting precipitation to the "Saturation" section or within the Magnesium range table note.
