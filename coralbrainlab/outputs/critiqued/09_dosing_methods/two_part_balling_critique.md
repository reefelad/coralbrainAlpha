# Critique Report: Two Part & Balling Method

## Safety Audit: PASS
No safety violations found. The content adheres to TIER 1 and TIER 2 safety constraints, specifically regarding Alkalinity stability and Salinity monitoring.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
Excellent overview of the Two-Part and Balling methods. The explanation of "Ionic Imbalance" and the role of "Part C" (NaCl-free sea salt) is particularly clear and valuable, adhering to the "Discovery First" principle. The inclusion of modern "Core7" context is relevant.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None identified.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Verification of Consumption Ratio]**
   - Location: Key Concepts > Calcification Stoichiometry
   - Problem: The text states "20 ppm Calcium for every 2.8 dKH".
   - Suggested fix: Verify the exact stoichiometry. Often cited as ~18-20ppm per 2.8dKH (1 meq/L). It is accurate enough for general use, but ensuring precision strengthens the "Science" aspect. 20ppm is a safe accepted approximation.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Typos] — "inadvertantly" should be "inadvertently" (Line 18).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS (Randy Holmes-Farley, Triton, Balling)
- [x] Discovery First: PASS (Explains the chemistry of ionic balance well)
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is solid, safe, and scientifically accurate. It effectively explains the progression from simple 2-part to the Balling method.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Fix typo "inadvertantly".
2. Ensure the link to [07_Filtration_Science] in Interfaces is correct (Refugium uptake might be more specifically under [07_Filtration_Science/Refugiums] if that subdomain exists, but general link is fine).
