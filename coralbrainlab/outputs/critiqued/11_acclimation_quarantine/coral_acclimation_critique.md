# Critique Report: Coral Acclimation & Pest Dipping

## Safety Audit: PASS
- **No TIER 1 violations.**
- Explicitly warns against adding dips to the display tank (critical).
- Correctly identifies lethal temperature limits (20-30°C) for the acclimation phase.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
A very high-quality document that balances biological theory with practical application. The framing of "radiant transition" for light acclimation is scientifically sound and aligns with the project's Discovery First philosophy.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None identified.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Vendor Plug Detachment**
   - Location: [Practical Application]
   - Problem: The primary vector for pest eggs (nudibranchs, flatworms) is the porous material of the frag plug itself.
   - Required fix: Add a recommendation to detach the coral from the vendor plug wherever possible and glue it to a new, sterile plug or directly to the rockwork. This is a Tier 2 best practice.
2. **"Acclimation Mode" Clarification**
   - Location: [Key Concepts]
   - Problem: The term "acclimation mode" is common but should be linked to specific hardware types mentioned in other domains (e.g., [16_lighting_systems]).
   - Required fix: Mention that this feature is standard on most modern LEDs (Ais, Radions) and should be used to reduce intensity by 30-50% initially.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Detail] — Mention that some corals (e.g., Zoanthids) are more tolerant of harsh dips than others (e.g., Smooth-skin Acroporas).
- [Detail] — Mention "pests" that dips might miss, like encrusting algae or vermetid snails.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is technically excellent. Addressing the frag plug issue will significantly increase its value for the "Stability First" mission.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Integrate the "Frag Plug Removal" protocol as a critical step in the pest prevention process.
2. Expand slightly on the "Acclimation Mode" for lighting.
3. Add a warning about dip sensitivity variations across coral types (SPS vs. Softies).
