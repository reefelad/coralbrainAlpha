# Critique Report: Visual Inspection & Dip (Pest Inspection)

## Safety Audit: PASS
Strong emphasis on personal safety (toxic chemicals) and system security (no dip in sump).

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is excellent and correctly highlights the biological reality of the "Egg-Cryptic Phase," which is the most common point of failure in hobbyist biosecurity. The "White Bowl" protocol is a practical and high-value addition.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: Bottom of file
   - Problem: Standard navigation footer is absent.
   - Required fix: Add footer with index, skeleton, previous, and next links.
   - Safety impact: N/A

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Interface Path Formatting**
   - Location: ## Interfaces
   - Problem: Links like `[11_acclimation_quarantine](acclimation_methods)` are incorrectly formatted for the directory structure.
   - Suggested fix: Use correct relative paths (e.g., `acclimation_methods.md`).
2. **Bayer Classification**
   - Location: ## Parameter Ranges
   - Problem: Bayer is listed as TIER-2, but since it's an off-label agricultural product, it should be clarified that it is an "Off-Label/Hobbyist Standard" and carries higher risk than purpose-built reef dips.
   - Suggested fix: Add a specific warning about off-label use for non-aquarium chemicals.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Consistency: Ensure "MEN" is spelled out in the summary table if mentioned by acronym elsewhere.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing footer)

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** Structural fixes and link corrections are required. The content is technically sound.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add Navigation Footer.
2. Fix Interface links.
3. Add a "Note on Off-Label Chemicals" to the Practical Application or Safety section.
