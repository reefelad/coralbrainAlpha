# Critique Report: Invertebrate Quarantine

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations identified. The absolute prohibition of copper and the focus on salinity stability are correctly emphasized.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The raw generation for the Invertebrate Quarantine subdomain is of high quality. It successfully applies "Discovery First" principles by explaining the tomont lifecycle and hemocyanin sensitivity. The inclusion of the 76-day fallow protocol provides a clear, science-based standard for safety.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Metabolic Debt & Acclimation]**
   - Location: Overview / Practical Application
   - Problem: While the `soul_state.json` mentioned linking "Metabolic Debt" to the rate of acclimation recovery, this specific phrasing isn't fully integrated into the raw content.
   - Suggested fix: Add a specific note on how shipping stress creates a metabolic debt that increases sensitivity during the initial quarantine phase.
2. **[Pathogen Specificity]**
   - Location: Key Concepts
   - Problem: The distinction between "fish-safe" and "invert-safe" medications (e.g., PraziPro vs Copper) could be more explicit.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly state that even "reef-safe" medications should be used with extreme caution in QT, as they may still stress sensitive inverts.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **[Aerosol Isolation]** — Practical Application: Mention aerosol isolation (distancing systems) to prevent cross-contamination between fish QT and invert QT, as noted in previous session learnings.
- **[Navigation Links]** — Navigation: Ensure the `acclimation_methods.md` link is valid or flagged as a pending subdomain.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is technically accurate and adheres to all project protocols. The requested fixes are primarily for synthesis with session-specific learnings rather than correctness issues.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Integrate the "Metabolic Debt" concept into the acclimation/observation section.
2. Explicitly mention "Aerosol Isolation" between QT systems.
3. Clarify the "Reef-Safe" medication caveat.
