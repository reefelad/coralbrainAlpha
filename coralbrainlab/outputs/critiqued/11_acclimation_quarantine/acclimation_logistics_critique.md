# Critique Report: Acclimation Logistics & Shipping Handling

## Safety Audit: PASS
- **No TIER 1 violations.**
- Correctly prohibits adding shipping water to the display tank (critical contamination prevention).
- Temperature shock limit of 3°C is within safe bounds (TIER 1 allows up to 5°C delta with gradual adjustment).

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
An excellent document that frames shipping as a "metabolic debt" problem—this is a strong Discovery First approach. The "Shipping Triangle" concept is scientifically sound and practical. Emergency intervention protocols are well-defined.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None identified.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Bag Opening Technique**
   - Location: [Practical Application]
   - Problem: The document mentions opening the bag for oxygen introduction but doesn't warn about the pH/ammonia rebound effect that occurs when CO₂ off-gasses.
   - Required fix: Add a warning that opening the bag causes rapid pH increase, which can convert ammonium → ammonia. This is why some experts recommend the "dump" method for foul water.
2. **Coral-Specific Logistics**
   - Location: [Practical Application]
   - Problem: The document is somewhat fish-centric. Corals have different shipping considerations (e.g., they can tolerate lower oxygen but are more sensitive to temperature swings).
   - Suggested fix: Add a subsection distinguishing fish vs. coral shipping requirements.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Detail] — Mention that "heat packs" or "cold packs" are commonly used by vendors and should be removed before floating bags.
- [Detail] — Specify that the "1/3 water, 2/3 gas" rule applies to fish; corals are often shipped with less water.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is technically excellent and safety-compliant. Addressing the pH rebound warning and coral-specific logistics will elevate it to a 10/10.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add pH/ammonia rebound warning when opening bags.
2. Distinguish fish vs. coral shipping requirements.
3. Mention heat/cold pack removal.
