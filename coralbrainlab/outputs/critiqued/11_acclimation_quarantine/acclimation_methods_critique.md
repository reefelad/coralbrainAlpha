# Critique Report: Acclimation Methods

## Safety Audit: PASS
No Tier 1 or Tier 2 safety violations found. The inclusion of the Ammonia Rebound effect and the Osmotic Homeostasis warnings for invertebrates are excellent safety-first additions.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The Generator has produced a high-quality, scientifically grounded extraction. The "Discovery First" approach is strongly applied through the concepts of Metabolic Debt and Biological Firewalls. The practical application section is clear and risk-stratified.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: Bottom of file
   - Problem: The required navigation footer (back to index, back to skeleton, next subdomain) is missing.
   - Required fix: Add the standardized navigation footer.
   - Safety impact: N/A

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Link Formatting in Interfaces**
   - Location: ## Interfaces
   - Problem: Links are formatted as `[02_lighting](acclimation_lighting)` which does not follow a clear file path structure (e.g., `../../02_lighting/subdomains/acclimation.md`).
   - Suggested fix: Update interfaces to use correct relative paths or standardized naming conventions.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Consistency in "Acclimation Required If..." table: The unit for Salinity is SG, while Temperature is °C. Ensure dKH is clear for Alkalinity. (Already mostly correct).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Missing footer)

## Verdict: REVISE

**Reasoning:** The content is excellent, but structural components (navigation) and link formatting need to be corrected before final compilation.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add Navigation Footer.
2. Correct Interface links to valid relative paths.
3. Ensure "Aerosol Isolation" is explicitly linked to the "Biological Firewall" concept for clarity.
