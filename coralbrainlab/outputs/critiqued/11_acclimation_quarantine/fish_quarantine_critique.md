# Critique Report: Fish Quarantine Protocols

## Safety Audit: PASS
- **No TIER 1 violations.**
- Correctly identifies ammonia as a lethal threat in small QT systems.
- Correctly identifies cross-contamination as a critical failure point.
- Safety limits for temperature and copper titration are within safe ranges.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
A very strong start for the Acclimation domain. The "biological firewall" metaphor is excellent for the Discovery First approach. The content is scientifically grounded and respects the Triton Method's "total separation" rule.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None identified.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Tank Transfer Method (TTM) omission**
   - Location: [Practical Application]
   - Problem: TTM is a widely used, non-chemical method for eliminating Cryptocaryon and is highly valued by aquarists who want to avoid the stress of copper.
   - Required fix: Add a brief subsection explaining the principle of TTM (moving fish every 72 hours to break the life cycle).
2. **Fallow Period Resolution**
   - Location: [Key Concepts]
   - Problem: The "76-day" fallow period is often debated (some say 72, some 80+). 
   - Required fix: Clarify that 76 days is the "conservative standard" for Ich verification, and link it to the longest recorded life cycle stage (tomont). [TIER-1: Colorni or similar].

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Detail] — Mention "Seachem Prime" or similar as an emergency tool for ammonia management.
- [Detail] — Specify that copper should never be used if "Part C" or other mineral supplements are added to the QT (though they shouldn't be).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is accurate and fits perfectly. The requested additions (TTM and fallow clarification) will move it from a 9 to a 10.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Integrate the Tank Transfer Method (TTM) into the Practical Application section.
2. Strengthen the scientific citation for the 76-day fallow period.
3. Add a note about the use of ammonia detoxifiers (Prime) in emergency scenarios.
