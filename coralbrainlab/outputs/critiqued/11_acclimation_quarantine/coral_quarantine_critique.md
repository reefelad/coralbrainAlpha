# Critique Report: Coral Quarantine Setup

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 safety violations detected. Recommendations for temperature, salinity, and alkalinity are all within established safe ranges.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The generator has produced a high-quality initial extraction for the Coral Quarantine subdomain. It correctly identifies the biological reasoning behind long-term isolation (pest life cycles) and emphasizes parameter consistency in line with Triton methodology.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1.  **Issue:** Lack of specific "Aerosol Isolation" distance verification.
    - Location: Key Concepts > Mechanical and Biological Barriers
    - Problem: While a 3-5 meter distance is mentioned, it's often physically impossible for hobbyists. 
    - Suggested fix: Recommend a physical lid or splash guard as a Tier-2 alternative for constrained spaces.
2.  **Issue:** Missing mention of "Red Bugs" specifically in the observation section.
    - Location: Key Concepts > Fragment Isolation & Observation
    - Problem: Red bugs are much harder to see than AEFW and need specific mention as a target for macro-observation.
    - Suggested fix: Add Tegastes acroporanus (Red Bugs) to the visualization protocol.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Formatting — Parameter table could include "Phosphates/Nitrates" to emphasize stability vs. nutrient load in QT.
- Clarification — Explicitly state that "Transfer Rinse" water should be discarded, not used to top up display.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is sound, scientifically accurate, and aligns perfectly with the Discovery First and Triton baseline principles. The few issues identified are refinements rather than corrections.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1.  Incorporate physical lid/splash guard as a mitigation for limited aerosol distance.
2.  Add specific mention of Red Bugs in the observation/inspection section.
3.  Add nutrient stability (N/P) context to the reference table.
