# Critique Report: Vendor Selection & Ethical Sourcing

## Safety Audit: PASS
- **No TIER 1 violations.**
- Correctly identifies CITES compliance and Cyanide-free guarantees as absolute ethical and biological safety constraints.
- Emphasizes stability and physiological resilience as the foundation for safe introduction.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The document provides a strong "Discovery First" framework, moving beyond a simple list of "good stores" to explain the biological rationale (metabolic reserves and immune resilience) for vendor auditing. It correctly categorizes sourcing into tiers and provides actionable steps for the aquarist to perform a vendor audit.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None identified.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Certification Labels**
   - Location: [Key Concepts > Ethical Sourcing Tiers]
   - Problem: The document mentions CITES but doesn't explicitly name common industry certifications like MAC (Marine Aquarium Council) or ORA/Sustainable Aquatics as specific examples of TIER-1 sourcing.
   - Suggested fix: Add specific examples of reputable certifications or mariculture facilities to ground the theory in recognizable industry labels.
2. **"Lazarus Species" Context**
   - Location: [Key Concepts]
   - Problem: The summary mentioned "Lazarus Species" (sensitive species requiring specialized handling) but the raw text didn't explicitly define or emphasize this group.
   - Suggested fix: Add a brief note on how vendor selection is even more critical for "High Risk" or "Sensitive" species (e.g., Copperband Butterflyfish, Moorish Idols, Acropora) compared to hardy ones.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Detail] — Mention that high-quality vendors often provide "DOA Guarantees" as a proxy for their confidence in their shipping and handling protocols.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The document is technically sound, safety-compliant, and perfectly aligned with the CoralBrainLab mission. The proposed additions are refinements that strengthen the practical utility of the knowledge.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add specific industry certification examples (MAC, ORA, etc.).
2. Emphasize vendor selection importance for sensitive/high-risk species.
3. Include "DOA Guarantees" as a quality indicator.
