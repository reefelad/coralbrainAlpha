# Critique Report: Cyano Management

## Safety Audit: PASS
- No TIER 1 safety violations found.
- Oxygen depletion warning for chemical treatments is correctly highlighted as a critical safety constraint.
- Antibiotic resistance risks are appropriately noted.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content provides an excellent, biologically-grounded explanation of cyanobacteria, distinguishing it clearly from algae issues. The "Discovery First" approach is strong, explaining the nitrogen fixation advantage and the role of ecological niches. The distinction between holistic (Triton) and chemical treatments is critical and well-articulated.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None identified.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Nitrate Range Precision]**
   - Location: Parameter Ranges table
   - Problem: The range "2.0 - 10.0 ppm" is slightly broad for a strict Triton context without qualification.
   - Suggested fix: Refine to Triton's ideal of "2-5 ppm" for SP dominated systems, but acknowledge higher ranges (up to 10) are acceptable if phosphate is balanced.

2. **[Chemiclean Dosing Details]**
   - Location: Safety Considerations
   - Problem: While the oxygen warning is present, the specific "20% water change" instruction is slightly buried in the prose.
   - Suggested fix: Make the post-treatment water change an explicit bullet point in the Safety section, as it is a critical step to remove dissolved organic carbon and medication residues.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Formatting] — In "Diagnosis & Immediate Action", step 2, "Scenario B" could explicitly mention reducing photoperiod as a temporary control measure alongside filtration.
- [Clarity] — The "Atomic (106:16:1) or 16:1" phrasing in the table might be confusing to laymen. Clarify that 16:1 is the N:P ratio specifically.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is safe, scientifically accurate, and aligns perfectly with Triton's "chemistry first" philosophy. The "Discovery First" explanation of nitrogen fixation is particularly strong. Minor tweaks to range precision will perfect it.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Refine Nitrate range to aligning closer with 2-5 ppm as the ideal target.
2. Emphasize the post-treatment water change in the Safety section.
