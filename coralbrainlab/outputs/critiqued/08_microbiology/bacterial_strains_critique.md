# Critique Report: Bacterial Strains & Diversity

## Safety Audit: PASS
No direct safety violations found. Dosing recommendations are conservative and include warnings about oxygen depletion which is critical for carbon dosing/bacterial blooms.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content provides a strong, scientifically accurate overview of bacterial strains in reef aquaria, correctly identifying modern understandings (Intro of *Nitrospira*) and distinguishing between autotrophic and heterotrophic functions. The safety warnings regarding bacterial blooms are well-placed.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None found.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Clarification on "Old Tank Syndrome"**
   - Location: Practical Application
   - Problem: While described as a loss of biodiversity, it is also often associated with the accumulation of refractory organic compounds or detritus in hard-to-reach places.
   - Suggested fix: Broaden the definition slightly to include "accumulation of waste and loss of biodiversity/monoculture".

2. **Refugium Connection**
   - Location: Interfaces
   - Problem: The connection to Refugium Design is implicit but should be explicit, as the refugium is a primary surface area for these bacteria.
   - Suggested fix: Add `[07_Filtration -> Refugium Design]` as a key interface for bacterial housing.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Formatting**: Ensure chemical formulas are consistently formatted (Subscript/Superscript usage relies on Markdown support, which is good, but just consistency check).
- **Probiotics details**: Could briefly mention that "probiotics" in reefing often overlap with "heterotrophic sludge consumers" in marketing, but scientific probiotics (Lactobacillus etc in fish gut) are slightly different.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The generated content is high quality, accurate, and safe. It follows the Discovery First principle effectively.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Expand the "Old Tank Syndrome" definition slightly.
2. Add the Refugium Design interface link.
3. Ensure the distinction/overlap between "Probiotics" and "Sludge Consumers" is clear.
