# Critique Report: Carbon Dosing (Organic) & Bacterial Populations

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations found. The warnings regarding Oxygen Depletion and Protein Skimming necessity are critical and correctly identified as absolute constraints.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is technically accurate, safe, and aligns well with the Triton Method's philosophy of using Carbon Dosing as a corrective tool rather than a primary filtration method (which is the Refugium). The "Discovery First" explanation of limiting factors is excellent.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **[Structure] Navigation Footer Missing**
   - Location: Bottom of document.
   - Problem: The standard navigation footer (Back to Index, Next/Prev) is missing.
   - Required fix: Add the navigation block.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Clarity] "Redfield Ratio" vs "Triton Ratio"**
   - Location: Key Concepts / TRITON N:C:P Ratio
   - Problem: While the concept is correct, explicitly stating that "Triton research has refined the classic Redfield Ratio" might imply a known fixed formula. It's safer to say Triton *applies* the principles of nutrient stoichiometry (N:C:P ratio) to aquarium management rather than claiming a formal redefinition of the biological constant.
   - Suggested fix: Soften language to emphasize practical application of ratio balancing rather than scientific redefinition.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Table Formatting**: Ensure the columns align cleanly in the markdown viewer (Visual check).
- **Source Specifics**: "Feldman et al." is a great source citation; adding the year (2011) would be a nice touch for authority.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Navigation missing)

## Verdict: PASS
Proceed to Refiner.

**Reasoning:** High quality content that only needs structural addition (navigation) and slight nuancing of the ratio explanation.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add Navigation Footer.
2. Clarify "Triton Ratio" application vs Redfield Ratio definition.
