# Critique Report: SPS Fragging Techniques

## Safety Audit: PASS
Air exposure and temperature shock constraints appropriately flagged as TIER-1.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
High-quality generation with excellent Discovery First structure. Explains the biological WHY (minimizing tissue trauma, skeletal grain) before procedural HOW. Branching vs. encrusting distinction is clear and actionable.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None.*

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Twist-Snap Clarification]**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Branching SPS
   - Problem: The "twist-snap" technique could be misinterpreted as twisting the cutters.
   - Suggested fix: Clarify that the twist is applied to the coral branch, not the tool.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **[Recovery Area Definition]** — Practical Application: Define what "low-flow recovery area" means (e.g., frag rack placement, PAR level).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** Content is accurate and follows all protocols. Minor clarification needed on technique description.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Clarify twist-snap technique (twist the branch, not tool).
2. Define recovery area parameters.
