# Critique Report: Boundary Layers & Gas Exchange

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations. The linkage between pH stability and the concentration gradient for proton export is a sophisticated and accurate safety consideration.

## Quality Score: 9.5/10

## Summary
Outstanding technical content. The explanation of the Diffusive Boundary Layer (DBL) as a "gateway" and its role in both day (calcification byproduct export) and night (respiration) cycles is exceptionally thorough and aligns perfectly with "Discovery First" principles.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **[Missing Section] Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of document
   - Problem: Navigation footer is missing.
   - Required fix: Add standard navigation block.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Technical Detail] Thermal Boundary Layer**
   - Location: Overview
   - Problem: While gas and waste exchange are covered, the role of flow in thinning the *Thermal* Boundary Layer (TBL) to prevent coral overheating under intense lighting is a key biological function.
   - Suggested fix: Add a brief mention of thermal exchange/heat dissipation alongside gas exchange.

2. **[Triton Alignment] ICP-MS Linkage**
   - Location: Key Concepts
   - Problem: The Triton methodology uses ICP testing to ensure the building blocks are in the bulk water, but the DBL is what determines if the coral can actually access them. This linkage underscores the importance of flow in a "Low Water Change" system.
   - Suggested fix: Add a note about the relationship between bulk water parameters (measured by ICP) and their availability to the coral host via the DBL.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- None.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Navigation missing)

## Verdict: PASS
Proceed to Refiner.

**Reasoning:** Only minor technical additions and structural requirements remain.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add Navigation Footer.
2. Include the Thermal Boundary Layer (TBL) and heat dissipation.
3. Link bulk ICP parameters to local availability via the DBL.
