# Critique Report: Pump Technologies & Specs

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations found. Siphon breaks and check valve warnings are properly documented.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The document provides a comprehensive and technically accurate overview of pump technologies, successfully aligning with Triton's 10x turnover methodology. The "Discovery First" approach is well-implemented in the overview.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Digital Integration / Sensor Feedback**
   - Location: Key Concepts or Practical Application
   - Problem: Minimal mention of how modern pump technology interfaces with sensors (specifically Flow Sensors) for real-time monitoring of turnover rates.
   - Suggested fix: Add a section or bullet point on Flow Sensors (TIER-2) as part of the "Intelligence" layer of pump technology.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Siphon Breaks Clarification — Practical Application — It would be beneficial to explicitly mention the "Sump Return Bulkhead Height" as a secondary fail-safe.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** The content is robust, safe, and scientifically sound. It meets the project's quality standards with only minor suggestions for enhancement.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Integrate Flow Sensor feedback as a key modern technology concept.
2. Ensure the "Gaps" section includes the lack of standardisation in "DC Pump Life Span" metrics.
3. Double-check the "Total Vertical Lift" formula for precision.
