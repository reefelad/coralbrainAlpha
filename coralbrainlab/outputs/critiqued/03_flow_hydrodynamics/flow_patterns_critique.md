# Critique Report: Flow Patterns (Laminar, Turbulent, Gyre)

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations. The warning about direct high-velocity shear on coral tissue is appropriate and scientifically sound.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is excellent. It deeply integrates biological reasoning (boundary layer physics and calcification byproduct export) with practical technical advice. The source tiering is accurate.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **[Missing Section] Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of document
   - Problem: Navigation footer is missing.
   - Required fix: Add the standard navigation block.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Triton Alignment] Detritus Suspension and Export**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Turbulent Flow
   - Problem: While detritus suspension is mentioned, the connection to the Triton Method's reliance on high sump turnover for *export* should be clearer. Turbulence suspends it, but the high turnover exports it.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly link turbulent display flow to the sump's export capacity.

2. **[Technical Detail] Reversible Gyre**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Gyre Flow
   - Problem: Modern gyre pumps often feature a "reversible" mode (alternating directions). This is a significant part of the "mass water movement" benefit as it prevents the "one-way" accumulation of detritus.
   - Suggested fix: Add a note about alternating or reversible gyre patterns.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- None.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Navigation missing)

## Verdict: PASS
Proceed to Refiner.

**Reasoning:** High quality content with only structural and minor technical enhancements required.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add Navigation Footer.
2. Link display turbulence to sump export efficiency.
3. Mention alternating/reversible gyre capabilities.
