# Critique Report: Protection for Anemones & LPS

## Safety Audit: PASS
Contains critical TIER 1 safety advice regarding not forcing stuck anemones. Proper warnings about intake grates and guard maintenance.

## Quality Score: 9.5/10

## Summary
An exceptionally well-written document that combines physical science (fluid shear, suction distribution) with practical aquarium management. The "Discovery First" approach is robust.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Overflow Protection**
   - Location: Key Concepts or Practical Application
   - Problem: The document focuses heavily on pump intakes but neglects the other major "mechanical predator": the overflow box/drain.
   - Suggested fix: Add a bullet point on protecting overflows using combs or mesh covers (TIER-2) to prevent anemones from entering the sump or clogging the drain line (a major flood risk).

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Toxin Release** — Overview — Brief mention that a "blendered" anemone can release enough toxins/nematocysts to crash a system would add weight to the safety section.

## Verification Checklist

## Verdict: PASS

**Reasoning:** High quality content with clear scientific reasoning. The addition of overflow protection will make this a complete safety guide for mobile invertebrates.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add overflow protection (combs/mesh) as a key safety concept.
2. Mention the biological impact (toxin release) of anemone injury.
3. Verify the spelling of technical terms (e.g., *Entacmaea quadricolor*).
