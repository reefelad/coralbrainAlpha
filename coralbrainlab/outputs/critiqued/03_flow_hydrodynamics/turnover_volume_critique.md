# Critique Report: Turnover & Volume Requirements

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations identified. The mention of lethal stagnation (4-6 hours) is accurate and provides the necessary biological context for the criticality of this parameter.

## Quality Score: 8.5/10

## Summary
The content is technically accurate, well-sourced, and maintains high alignment with Triton methodology. The "Discovery First" principles are effectively applied in the overview and key concepts.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **[Missing Section] Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of document
   - Problem: The navigation footer required by the domain template is missing.
   - Required fix: Add the standard navigation block.
   - Safety impact: None (Structural only).

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Technical Detail] Calcification Byproducts**
   - Location: Overview / Biological WHY
   - Problem: While nutrient delivery and gas exchange are mentioned, the role of flow in removing metabolic waste and calcification byproducts (like protons/acid) from the coral's immediate vicinity is missing.
   - Suggested fix: Add a mention of "metabolic waste removal" or "preventing localized acidification" to the biological WHY.

2. **[Triton Alignment] Refugium Detritus Management**
   - Location: Key Concepts - Sump Turnover
   - Problem: For the Triton method, the 10x turnover is also specifically to prevent detritus from settling within the dense macroalgae bed. This is a key practical reason for the high flow.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly mention that high turnover prevents detritus accumulation in the refugium.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Typo in "Triton Recommendation"** — The rationale could mention that the 10x is a *minimum* for Triton.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: FAIL (Navigation missing)

## Verdict: PASS
Proceed to Refiner with corrections.

**Reasoning:** The content is very strong on methodology and science. The missing structural element and minor technical additions can be easily handled by the Refiner.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add standard Navigation footer.
2. Include the role of byproduct removal in the "Biological WHY".
3. Add the practical note about detritus prevention in the refugium.
