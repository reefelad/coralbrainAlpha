# Critique Report: Feeding Response Signs

## Safety Audit: PASS
- Correct identification of ammonia risks and nutrient accumulation issues.

## Quality Score: 8/10

## Summary
The content provides a good overview of the biological signals of coral feeding. The "Scent Trigger" technique is a high-value practical inclusion. However, some nuances regarding mesenteric filaments and specific priming agents need clarification.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Mesenteric Filament Nuance**
   - Location: Key Concepts > Immediate Behavioral Responses
   - Problem: The content presents mesenteric filaments primarily as "feeding threads." While some species use them for external digestion, they are significantly more common as a response to chemical irritation, physical injury, or intra-coral aggression. Presenting them as a "sign of capture readiness" without strong qualification may cause users to misinterpret stress/aggression as a positive feeding response.
   - Suggested fix: Clarify that mesenteric filaments are a "high-utility" adaptation but are often indicators of stress or aggression rather than purely nutritional capture.
2. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of document
   - Problem: Structural template violation.
   - Required fix: Add navigation footer.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Specific Amino Acids** — In the Practical Application section, mention that L-amino acids (e.g., Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid) are the most common triggers for chemoreception in Cnidarians.
- **False Response Warning** — Enhance the note on activated carbon. If carbon is too "fresh" or over-used, it can strip the water of the very pheromones/chemicals that facilitate the chemoreceptive response.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: REVISE (Navigation missing)

## Verdict: PASS
**Reasoning:** Technically accurate and well-structured, but needs the mesenteric filament distinction to prevent hobbyist misinterpretation.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Qualify the "Mesenteric Filament" section with a clear distinction between feeding and aggression/stress.
2. Add Navigation Footer.
3. Include specific L-amino acid examples for priming.
