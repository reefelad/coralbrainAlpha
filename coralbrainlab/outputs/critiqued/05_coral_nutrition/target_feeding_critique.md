# Critique Report: Target Feeding Protocols

## Safety Audit: PASS
- No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations identified. The content correctly identifies the risks of oxygen demand and nutrient spikes.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
The content is technically sound, biologically grounded, and well-aligned with Triton methodology. The "Energy vs. Building Blocks" distinction in the Overview is a strong application of Discovery First principles.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **Missing Navigation Footer**
   - Location: End of document
   - Problem: The document does not follow the required structure template regarding navigation.
   - Suggested fix: Add the standard navigation footer linking back to index and skeleton.
2. **Skimmer/O2 Interaction**
   - Location: Safety Considerations
   - Problem: While oxygen demand is mentioned, the specific compounding factor of turning off the protein skimmer (a primary aeration source) during feeding is not explicitly linked.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly state that disabling skimmers during feeding temporarily reduces gas exchange exactly when biological oxygen demand (BOD) peaks.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- **Specific Coral Warnings** — Add more examples to the "internal rot" warning (e.g., Cynarina, Trachyphyllia).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: REVISE (Navigation missing)

## Verdict: PASS
**Reasoning:** The content is of high quality and scientific accuracy. The structural omission (navigation) and minor detail additions can be easily handled by the Refiner.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Add Navigation Footer.
2. Enhance Safety Considerations with the Skimmer/O2 interaction note.
3. Add specific examples of coral species prone to overfeeding issues.
