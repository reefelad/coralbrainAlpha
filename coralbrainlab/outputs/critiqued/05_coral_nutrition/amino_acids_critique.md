# Critique Report: Amino Acids & Vitamins

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations identified. The cyano-trigger warning is appropriate for this domain.

## Quality Score: 8.5/10

## Summary
A scientifically sound and logically structure subdomain. It effectively bridge the gap between biological growth and the "bottled" reality of the hobby.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Organic Load Relationship]**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Practical Application
   - Problem: Amino acids are both a Nitrogen source and a Carbon source. Dosing them contributes to the DOC pool discussed in 05_dissolved_organics.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly mention that amino acid dosing must be accounted for in the overall DOC management strategy.
2. **[Triton Specificity]**
   - Location: Key Concepts
   - Problem: While the refugium is the primary source, Triton does offer the "Infuse" range for intentional organic nutrition.
   - Suggested fix: Briefly mention the Triton Infuse range (with Component One/Two and Expand) as the methodology's verified path for supplemental aminos/vitamins when the refugium is insufficient.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Carrier Protein Saturation] — Mention that corals have a "saturation point" for aminos; adding more than they can absorb is purely pollutive.

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS
**Reasoning:** High quality content. The "Important" fixes will further align it with the specific Triton methodology and the previous subdomains.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Link to the DOC pool (contribution to organic load).
2. Incorporate specific Triton Infuse methodology details.
3. Address the absorption saturation limit.
