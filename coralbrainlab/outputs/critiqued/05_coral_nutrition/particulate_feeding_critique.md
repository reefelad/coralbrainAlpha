# Critique Report: Particulate Organic Matter (POM) & Marine Snow

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations. The warning regarding decomposition load and the nitrogen cycle is appropriate.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
A very strong subdomain. The distinction between energy (sugars) and building blocks (N, P, Lipids) is one of the best "Discovery First" explanations in the project so far.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[The Sponge Loop Connection]**
   - Location: Key Concepts
   - Problem: The previous subdomain (Dissolved Organics) introduced the Sponge Loop. This subdomain is where that process "completes"—sponges shed POM (cells/waste) that corals eat.
   - Suggested fix: Explicitly link back to 05_dissolved_organics by explaining that sponges convert DOC into the very POM discussed here.
2. **[Night-time Feeding]**
   - Location: Practical Application
   - Problem: Most coral heterotrophy (polyp extension for particulate capture) occurs at night.
   - Suggested fix: Add a subsection on "Circadian Feeding cycles" and how this influences when to dose or when to bypass mechanical filtration.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- [Mechanical Filtration Bypass] — Provide more specific detail on how "bypassing" filtration works (e.g., turning off return pump vs. removing socks).

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Safety TIER 1: PASS
- [x] Triton alignment: PASS
- [x] Source quality: PASS
- [x] Discovery First: PASS
- [x] Completeness: PASS
- [x] Structure: PASS

## Verdict: PASS
**Reasoning:** The content is accurate and highly educational. The connection to the Sponge Loop and night-time cycles will make it more cohesive with the rest of the domain.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Explicitly link the "Sponge Loop" as a primary source of POM.
2. Add "Circadian Feeding Cycles" to Practical Application.
3. Strengthen the distinction between "Live Zooplankton" (Prey) and "Marine Snow" (Aggregates).
