# Critique Report: Dissolved Organic Compounds (DOC)

## Safety Audit: PASS
No TIER 1 or TIER 2 safety violations identified. The warning about oxygen depletion and the DOC/PO4 synergy for RTN risk is excellent and adheres to safety protocols.

## Quality Score: 9/10

## Summary
A comprehensive and well-structured subdomain that perfectly captures the "Discovery First" philosophy. The inclusion of the Sponge Loop and the microbial shift explanation provides the necessary scientific depth before moving to management strategies.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
None.

## Important Issues (Should Fix)
1. **[Nitrogen component]**
   - Location: Key Concepts / Practical Application
   - Problem: The Triton N-DOC test specifically highlights the Nitrogen to Carbon (C:N) ratio in the organic pool. The current draft focuses almost exclusively on the Carbon (DOC) aspect.
   - Suggested fix: Add a concept or detail explaining the "Organic Nitrogen" part of the N-DOC test and why the ratio matters for preventing slime/algae vs favoring coral growth.

## Minor Issues (Nice to Fix)
- Location: Practical Application — GAC usage. Explicitly mention that while GAC is essential, over-use of low-quality or dusty carbon can be a source of stress (though usually covered in filtration equipment).

## Verification Checklist

## Verdict: PASS
**Reasoning:** The document is of very high quality. The "Important" issue regarding the Nitrogen component of the N-DOC test can be easily handled during the REFINE phase.

**Priority Fixes for Refiner:**
1. Integrate the Nitrogen component of the N-DOC test (Organic Nitrogen vs DOC ratio).
2. Clarify that the "Bad DOC" isn't just quantity, but the lack of Nitrogen-rich organics (Corals prefer a specific ratio).
3. Ensure GAC management notes mention the danger of "stripping" water too fast in ultra-high light environments (Acclimation interface).
