# Treatment Dips & Baths

## Overview
Corals have evolved complex biological defenses against native pests and pathogens, but when moved into the artificial environment of a reef aquarium, they often encounter concentrated populations of specialized parasitic or predatory relationships without the natural predators found in the wild. Understanding the biological vulnerability of these pests is the key to effective treatment. Coral "dips" are targeted chemical or osmotic sessions designed to exploit these vulnerabilities—specifically the pest's nervous system or cellular integrity—while preserving the coral’s own tissues.

The primary mechanism of a dip is to create an environment that is lethal to the parasite but within the stress-tolerance threshold of the coral animal. For example, **osmotic shock** (freshwater baths) leverages the difference in cellular pressure to rupture pest cells, whereas **neurotoxins** (pinewood oil, plant-based soaps, or certain insecticides) target the locomotive abilities of pests like *Acropora*-eating flatworms or Red Bugs, interfering with their ability to grip the host. **Iodine-based dips** provide a secondary benefit by acting as a broad-spectrum antiseptic, assisting in tissue repair and preventing opportunistic bacterial infections like *Vibrio* from colonizing stressed or damaged areas post-handling.

## Key Concepts

### Osmotic Pressure Manipulation (Freshwater Dips)
Parasites and pests often lack the advanced osmoregulation capabilities that corals (specifically zoanthids and some soft corals) possess. Exposing a coral to a brief bath of different salinity creates an osmotic gradient. Water physically rushes into the pest's cells (in freshwater), causing them to swell and rupture or detach, while the coral can temporarily seal itself off or tolerate the stress.

### Oxidative Disinfection (Hydrogen Peroxide)
Hydrogen Peroxide ($H_2O_2$) acts as a powerful oxidizer, reacting aggressively with organic biofilms, nuisance algae, and the delicate tissues of certain soft-bodied pests. While corals naturally produce small amounts of peroxide as a defense mechanism, external application exploits the difference in surface area and cellular protection to "burn" away pests and algae from frag plugs without penetrating the coral's skeleton too deeply.

### Neurotoxic Inhibition (Botanicals & Insecticides)
Botanicals like pine oil (Revive) or tea tree oil, and concentrated insecticides (Bayer/Cyfluthrin), work by disrupting the nervous system of complex pests. These agents do not necessarily kill the pest immediately but inhibit its synaptic function. This causes the pest to seize and lose its grip on the coral tissue, allowing it to be blown off with gentle flow during the dip.

### Antiseptic & Tissue Healing (Iodine)
Iodine (Lugol’s or commercial dips) is a vital trace element for coral health. In high concentrations (dips), it serves as a potent antiseptic. This is critical after fragmentation or handling, as it halts the spread of bacterial infections and provides the raw material needed for rapid tissue regeneration and mucus coat restoration.

## Practical Application

### Standard Dipping Protocol
1.  **Acclimation:** Float bag for temperature, then move coral to a dedicated container with tank water (do not put bag water in tank).
2.  **Add Dip:** Add the dipping agent according to the specific ratio (see table).
3.  **Agitation:** Use a turkey baster to gently blast the coral every few minutes. This disliking pests and ensures the solution reaches deep crevices.
4.  **Inspection:** Look for falling flatworms, bugs, or spiders.
5.  **Rinsing:** Crucial step. Move coral to a *second* container of clean tank water to rinse off chemicals. Ideally, use a *third* rinse for sensitive SPS or when using strong insecticides.

### Common Dilution Ratios
*   **Bayer (BioAdvanced) Insect Killer:** ~10ml per 250ml (1 cup) of tank water. Solution will turn milky white. [TIER-3]
*   **Hydrogen Peroxide (3%):** 1:10 ratio (1 part 3% $H_2O_2$ to 10 parts saltwater) for algae removal. Dipping just the frag plug is safer than dipping the whole coral. [TIER-2]
*   **Iodine (Lugol's):** ~40 drops per gallon (follow manufacturer specific instructions as concentration varies). [TIER-1]

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Dip Type | Exposure Time | Target | Dilution/Notes | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Iodine-based** | 10-15 Min | Bacterial / Antiseptic | Follow Bottle Instructions. Safe for most corals. | [TIER-1] |
| **Pine Oil / Botanical** | 10 Min | General Pests (Detachment) | Follow Bottle Instructions. Rinse well. | [TIER-2] |
| **Hydrogen Peroxide (3%)** | 1-2 Min | Algae / Biofilm / Some Pests | 1:10 Ratio. **Caution with SPS.** | [TIER-2] |
| **Bayer (Insecticide)** | 10-15 Min | Red Bugs / AEFW | ~10ml per 250ml. **Toxic to shrimp/crabs.** | [TIER-3] |
| **Osmotic (Freshwater)** | 3-5 Min | Zoanthid Spiders / Nudis | Freshwater (pH matched). **Zoanthids/Palys ONLY.** | [TIER-2] |

## Safety Considerations
⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Temperature Stability:** The dip water must be maintained at the same temperature as the display tank (+/- 1°C) to avoid thermal shock on top of chemical stress.
*   **pH Stability:** particularly for freshwater dips, the water must be buffered to match the display tank pH (approx 8.0-8.3) to prevent acidic shock.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Mucus Monitoring:** If a coral shows excessive stringy mucus or begins to bleach (expel zooxanthellae) during a dip, remove it immediately.
*   **Toxicity Barrier:** Insecticides (Bayer) are extremely toxic to crustaceans (shrimp, crabs, pods). Ensure zero carry-over into the display tank by using a double or triple rinse method. Do not dispose of dip water in the sink if possible; follow local disposal guidelines.
