# Coral Acclimation & Pest Dipping

## Overview
Corals are highly specialized organisms that have evolved to thrive in the ultra-stable environments of tropical reefs. When a coral is moved from a vendor's system, through shipping, and into a home aquarium, it undergoes a series of **metabolic shocks**. The primary purpose of acclimation is not just to match water parameters, but to manage the biological stress of transition. A coral that is not properly acclimated may suffer from photo-inhibition (light shock), osmotic stress, or the introduction of devastating "hitchhiker" pests that can collapse an entire ecosystem.

From a **Discovery First** perspective, acclimation is the process of gently re-aligning the coral's internal chemical balance and its symbiotic zooxanthellae population with the new environment. While fish require a "biological firewall" (quarantine), corals require a "chemical firewall" (pest dipping) and a "radiant transition" (light acclimation). In the Triton Method, where stability is the ultimate goal, these procedures ensure that new additions strengthen the system rather than introducing instability.

## Key Concepts

### Pest Dipping: The Chemical Firewall
The introduction of a single pest—such as Acropora Eating Flatworms (AEFW), Montipora Eating Nudibranchs, or Red Bugs—can lead to a colony-wide infestation. These pests have no natural predators in most home systems and can consume coral tissue at a rate that exceeds growth.
- **Mechanism:** Dipping involves placing the coral in a concentrated solution of botanical or chemical insecticides (e.g., Pine oil, Citrus extracts, or Iodine-based dips).
- **Coral Type Sensitivity:** Note that sensitivity varies. Smooth-skin Acroporas (SPS) are highly sensitive to aggressive dips, whereas Zoanthids or Mushrooms (Soft Corals) typically tolerate harsher treatments.
- **Limitations:** Most dips kill adult pests but **do not kill eggs**. This necessitates detailed manual inspection and potentially repeated dipping protocols.

### Light Acclimation: Preventing Photo-Inhibition
Corals utilize zooxanthellae to produce energy from light. If a coral moved from a low-PAR environment (e.g., a shipping box or a dim holding tank) is suddenly placed under high-intensity LEDs, the zooxanthellae can over-produce oxygen radicals. This "oxidative stress" damages the coral's tissue and leads to "bleaching" (the expulsion of the symbiotic algae).
- **Acclimation Mode:** Most modern LED controllers (e.g., AI, Ecotech) include a dedicated "Acclimation Mode." This feature should be set to reduce the normal intensity by 30-50% initially, gradually increasing back to the target intensity over 14-21 days.

### Osmotic Shock and Drip Acclimation
While corals are generally tolerant of minor salinity shifts, they are sensitive to the *rate* of osmotic change.
- **Drip Acclimation:** Slowly adding tank water to the shipping water over 30-60 minutes minimizes internal cellular stress.
- **The "Quick Transition" School:** Some experts argue that the accumulation of ammonia/waste in shipping water makes a fast transition into clean water preferable to a long drip, provided temperature is matched.

## Practical Application

### The 5-Step Advanced Protocol
1.  **Temperature Match:** Float the sealed bag in the display or sump for 15-20 minutes.
2.  **Pest Dip:** 
    - Use a dedicated container with tank water and the recommended dip dose (e.g., CoralRX, Revive).
    - Use a Turkey Baster to gently blow water into the coral's structure to dislodge pests. **Time:** 5–10 minutes.
3.  **Frag Plug Removal (Crucial):** Wherever possible, detach the coral from the vendor's frag plug using bone cutters or a scalpel. The porous ceramic or stone of the plug is the primary hiding spot for pest eggs that dips cannot kill.
4.  **Rinse:** Move the coral to a second container with clean tank water to remove residual dip chemicals. Never allow dip to enter the display.
5.  **Placement:** Glue the coral to a new, sterile plug or directly to the rockwork. Place it low in the tank (on the sand bed) for the first 5-7 days.

### Manual Inspection (The "Egg Hunt")
Even after dipping, use a magnifying glass to inspect the coral's base. 
- **Action:** If small clusters of white/brown circles (eggs) are found, scrape them off or smother the area with cyanoacrylate (super glue).

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Parameter | Threshold for Action | Note | Source |
|-----------|----------------------|------|--------|
| Temp Delta | > 2°C | Float required | [TIER-2] |
| Salinity Delta | > 2 ppt | Drip acclimation recommended | [TIER-2] |
| Dip Duration | > 15 mins | Can cause tissue damage to SPS | [TIER-2] |
| Light Reduction | 30% - 50% | Starting "Acclimation Mode" setting | [TIER-1] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Dip Toxicity:** Never add coral dips directly to the display tank. These chemicals are designed to kill invertebrates and will collapse the system's biological balance.
- **Temperature Limits:** Never acclimate if the shipping water is below 20°C or above 30°C without stabilizing it first.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Avoid Shared Dips:** Never reuse a dip for corals from different sources to prevent cross-contamination.
- **Acclimation Timing:** Perform acclimation when the aquarium's main lights are off or at minimum intensity to reduce immediate photo-stress.
