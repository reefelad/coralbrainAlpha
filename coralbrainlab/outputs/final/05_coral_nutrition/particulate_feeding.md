# Particulate Organic Matter (POM) & Marine Snow

## Overview
While corals derive a significant portion of their energy from the photosynthetic byproducts of their symbiotic zooxanthellae (autotrophy), they are also highly efficient predators and suspension feeders (heterotrophy). In many reef environments, autotrophy provides the carbon for daily metabolic maintenance, but it is the capture of Particulate Organic Matter (POM)—often referred to as "Marine Snow"—that provides the vital building blocks of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and complex lipids required for tissue growth, skeletal matrix production, and reproduction.

Marine snow consists of macroscopic aggregates of organic debris, mucus, and dead plankton that act as high-energy "islands" in the water column. This biological recycling is enhanced by the **Sponge Loop**, where encrusting sponges take up dissolved organic matter and shed it as particulate detritus. For the reef aquarist, bridging the "heterotrophic gap" by maintaining a target level of POM is the key to achieving the thick tissue and vibrant growth seen in wild colonies, moving beyond simple survival to biological thriving.

## Key Concepts

### Marine Snow Composition & The Sponge Loop
Natural marine snow is a complex biological aggregate. It is primarily composed of transparent exopolymer particles (TEP), coral mucus, and fecal pellets. A critical contributor to this pool is the **Sponge Loop**, a pathway where sponges consume vast amounts of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) and convert it into particulate detritus. This detritus shed by sponges is a high-value food source for corals, effectively "recycling" invisible dissolved energy back into the visible particulate food web.

### Capture Mechanisms
Corals utilize several distinct strategies for particulate capture:
1.  **Nematocyst Capture:** Stinging cells on tentacles used for live zooplankton and larger organic aggregates.
2.  **Ciliary Mucoid Feeding:** Using cilia to move trapped particles across the mucus-coated surface toward the mouth.
3.  **Extocoelomic Digestion:** Some corals (particularly LPS) can extend mesenterial filaments to digest organic matter externally on the skeleton or substrate. [TIER-1: Coral Biology Textbooks]

### The "Heterotrophic Gap"
Photosynthesis primarily provides sugars (glucose, glycerol), which are high in energy but low in the essential elements needed to build protein. Without sufficient particulate intake, corals can suffer from "starvation in the light"—where they have ample carbon energy but lack the nitrogen and phosphorus to grow new tissue. Heterotrophic feeding is especially critical during thermal stress, as it provides the metabolic fuel for the coral to survive until its symbiont populations recover.

### Particulate Nutrients in the Triton Method
The Triton Method favors a "naturalistic" approach to POM. The large-scale algae refugium serves as a generator of particulate matter, including larval stages of micro-fauna and detrital particles from macro-algae. This provides a constant, low-level "drip" of naturally occurring marine snow, avoiding the localized nutrient spikes and oxygen dips associated with heavy manual "broadcast" feeding.

## Practical Application

### Circadian Feeding Cycles
Most coral heterotrophy occurs at night. Polyps typically extend more fully during darkness to coincide with the vertical migration of zooplankton and to avoid conflict with daytime photosynthetic processes.
- **Night Feeding Strategy:** To maximize nutrient uptake, manual feeding or the bypass of mechanical filtration (e.g., turning off fleece rollers or removing filter socks) should occur during the first few hours of the "lights out" cycle.
- **Flow Adjustment:** In some systems, reducing flow slightly during the feeding window allows larger aggregates of marine snow to settle onto polyp surfaces.

### Supporting Natural POM
- **Refugium Integration:** A healthy refugium is the most consistent source of live particulate matter for a reef system.
- **Detritus Management:** While detritus is a source of POM, it must be kept suspended. Strong, turbulent flow prevents detritus from settling into "dead spots" where it can decompose into ammonia rather than being captured as food.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Category | Typical Size | Nutritional Role | Source |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| Picoplankton | 0.2 – 2 µm | Bacterial/Sponge feeding | [TIER-1] |
| Nanoplankton | 2 – 20 µm | Small polyp corals (SPS) | [TIER-1] |
| Microplankton | 20 – 200 µm | General coral feeding (LPS/SPS) | [TIER-1] |
| Marine Snow | > 0.5 mm | Large aggregates / Sponge waste | [TIER-1] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Decomposition Load:** Never add more particulate matter than the system's biological and mechanical filtration can process. Excess unconsumed POM leads to rapid ammonia spikes and localized oxygen depletion (<4 mg/L) within the substrate.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Nutrient Balance:** If Phosphate is already >0.15 ppm, suspend heavy particulate feeding until inorganic nutrients are brought back into range to avoid fueling pathogenic shifts in the microbiome.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] Precise measurement of POM concentration in a hobbyist setting remains difficult, usually relying on visual clarity/tint as a proxy.
- [VERIFY] The extent to which certain modern "ultra-clean" filtration methods (O3/UV) permanently deplete the natural marine snow cycle by killing the bacteria that form the core of the aggregates.
