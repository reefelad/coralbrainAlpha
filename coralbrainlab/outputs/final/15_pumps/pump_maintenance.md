# Pump Maintenance & Calibration

## Overview
The mechanical reliability of aquarium pumps is directly proportional to the consistency of their maintenance. In the high-alkalinity, high-calcium environment of a reef tank, pumps operate in a constant state of chemical attrition. Biologically, the primary goal of maintenance is the **prevention of flow decay**. As calcium carbonate (limescale) accumulates on the impeller and shaft, frictional resistance increases, leading to a silent reduction in turnover. This decline can create stagnant zones and localized nutrient spikes before the pump eventually seizes. A rigorous maintenance protocol ensures that the system's "heart" maintains the oxygenation and nutrient transport required by the most sensitive coral species.

From a technical perspective, pump maintenance is about managing **thermal and chemical stress**. The heat generated by the pump's motor block creates a localized zone of low CO2 solubility, which triggers the precipitation of solid calcium carbonate. If left unchecked, this buildup scores ceramic shafts and can even cause impeller magnets to swell and fail. Properly cleaning and inspecting these components every 90-120 days preserves efficiency and extends the operational life of the hardware.

## Key Concepts

### The Calcification Cycle in Pumps
- **Thermal Precipitation:** The internal surfaces of the pump (impeller/shaft) are often slightly warmer than the surrounding water. This localized temperature increase drives the chemical precipitation of calcium carbonate from the saturated reef water.
- **Frictional Wear:** Solid calcium crystals act as an abrasive. As the impeller spins, these crystals "sand down" the ceramic shaft and the internal housing, leading to permanent noise and efficiency loss. [TIER-1: Engineering Standards]

### Building "Maintenance-First" Systems
- **Dosing Placement:** To minimize the calcification cycle, all chemical dosing (Alkalinity, Calcium, Kalkwasser) should occur **downstream** of the return pump intake. Dosing into the same chamber as the return pump causes immediate scaling on the motor block. [TIER-1: Triton Methodology]
- **Diagnostic Wattage:** Monitor the pump's power draw (Watts) via smart controllers. A pump drawing 10-20% more wattage than its rated "clean" state is likely fighting frictional buildup on the shaft and requires immediate service. [TIER-2]

## Practical Application

### Maintenance Protocol: The 90-Day Deep Clean
1. **Intake Screen:** Clean the pump cage or intake screen of all biofilm, sponges, and calcified tube worms. A blocked intake causes **cavitation**, which creates micro-bubbles that erode the impeller and cause excessive heat.
2. **Disassemble & Document:** carefully strip the pump down. Record or photograph the orientation of directional impellers or specialized ceramic bushings.
3. **Soak:** Submerge all non-electronic components in a **Citric Acid solution** (1 cup per gallon of warm water) for 2-4 hours. 
4. **Impeller & Shaft Inspection:**
    - **Ceramic Shaft:** Check for scoring or pitting. Ceramic is brittle; handle with extreme care.
    - **Impeller Magnet:** Check for "bloating" or cracks in the plasticized coating. [TIER-1]
5. **Lubricate & Reseat:** Apply a thin film of **Food-Grade Silicone Grease** (Molykote 111) to O-rings and seats. This ensures a watertight seal and prevents O-rings from becoming brittle over time. [TIER-2]

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Component | Maintenance Action | Diagnostic Indicator |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Impeller** | Citric Acid Soak | Rise in noise level (dB) |
| **Intake Screen** | Mechanical Scrub | Drop in flow rate (GPH) |
| **Motor Block** | Inspect for heat | Rise in Wattage (W) |
| **Ceramic Shaft** | Handle with care | Visual scoring/Pitting |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Ceramic Shaft Fragility:** Never use pliers or excessive force on a ceramic shaft. A micro-fracture will lead to catastrophic disintegration at high RPM. [TIER-1]
- **Magnet Swelling:** If an impeller magnet shows ANY sign of expansion or the internal core is visible, it MUST be replaced. Exposed cores leach heavy metals (Iron, Copper, Chrome) directly into the reef water column. [TIER-1]
- **Cavitational Exposure:** Do not run pumps with restricted intakes for prolonged periods; the resulting heat can warp the internal motor housing. [TIER-1]

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Citric Priority:** Use Citric Acid over Vinegar to prevent plasticizer leaching and the oxidation of internal impeller magnets. [TIER-2]
- **Calibration:** Perform a manual flow test (bucket test) after major maintenance to re-verify system turnover targets. [TIER-2]
