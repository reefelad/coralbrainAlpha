# LPS Fragging Techniques

## Overview
Large Polyp Stony (LPS) corals, including popular genera like Euphyllia (torch, hammer, frogspawn), Acanthastrea, Favia, and Scolymia, present unique challenges for propagation. Unlike SPS corals with their compact polyps, LPS have expansive fleshy tissue that extends well beyond the skeletal base. This tissue is highly sensitive to mechanical trauma.

The biological reason LPS fragging is more difficult than SPS is **tissue-to-skeleton ratio**. LPS polyps contain significant biomass—their large tentacles and oral disc represent substantial metabolic investment. Cutting through active tissue results in immediate cell death, mucus release (stress response), and creates an entry point for bacterial infection. The key to successful LPS fragging is cutting through **skeleton only**, never through living tissue.

## Key Concepts

### Skeletal Anatomy of Euphyllia
Euphyllia species have a distinctive structure:
- **Wall type:** Multiple polyps share a continuous skeletal wall—very difficult to separate without tissue damage.
- **Branching type:** Individual polyps grow on separate skeletal stalks—easier to frag at the stalk base [TIER-2: Reef2Reef].

Because of this, **branching Euphyllia** (torch, hammer, frogspawn with distinct heads) are the primary candidates for fragging. Wall-type Euphyllia should generally not be fragged due to poor survival rates.

### Tissue Retraction Principle
Before cutting, LPS corals should be encouraged to retract their tissue as much as possible:
- Remove the coral from the display and allow it to sit in a container of tank water.
- Gentle agitation or brief air exposure will encourage polyp retraction.
- Once tissue is retracted, the skeletal cutting zone becomes visible [TIER-2: BRS].

### Cut Below the Tissue Line
The critical rule: make cuts **well below** where tissue attaches to skeleton.
- On branching Euphyllia, this means cutting the stalk 0.5-1 inch below the polyp's base.
- Never attempt to cut through a polyp to "split" it—this is almost always fatal.

## Practical Application

### Workflow: Fragging Branching Euphyllia (Torch/Hammer)
1.  **Remove and Settle:** Transfer the mother colony to a container with tank water. Allow to settle for 5-10 minutes.
2.  **Encourage Retraction:** Gently agitate the water or briefly lift the coral to encourage tissue retraction.
3.  **Identify Cut Points:** Locate individual heads on their skeletal stalks. Find a point 0.5-1 inch below the tissue line.
4.  **Cut with Saw or Dremel:** Use a band saw or Dremel with diamond cutoff wheel for cleanest results. When using a Dremel, work quickly in short bursts to avoid heat buildup near tissue. Bone cutters can be used but risk crushing [TIER-2: Simplicity Aquatics].
5.  **Rinse Immediately:** Place frag in clean tank water to rinse debris.
6.  **Iodine Dip:** Transfer to an iodine solution (e.g., Lugol's, Brightwell Restor) for 5-10 minutes to disinfect the cut [TIER-2: Reef2Reef].
7.  **Mount:** Dry the base, apply coral putty or cyanoacrylate gel to a frag plug, and attach the frag securely.
8.  **Recovery Placement:** Place in low-light, low-flow area for 1-2 weeks. Feed 2-3x weekly to support healing.

### Workflow: Fragging Favia / Favites
1.  **Assess the Colony:** These massive corals have multiple polyps in a shared skeleton.
2.  **Band Saw Required:** Due to thick skeleton, a band saw is necessary.
3.  **Cut Between Polyps:** Identify valleys between polyps (corallite walls) and cut through these zones.
4.  **Avoid Polyp Centers:** Never cut through a polyp's mouth—this is fatal.
5.  **Post-Cut Care:** As above: rinse, iodine dip, mount, recover.

### When NOT to Frag LPS
- **Wall-type Euphyllia:** High mortality; shared tissue cannot be divided without damage.
- **Stressed or sick colonies:** Fragging adds energy cost; only frag healthy specimens.
- **Recently acquired corals:** Allow 4+ weeks of acclimation before fragging.

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Never Cut Through Tissue:** Cutting through LPS polyp tissue leads to infection and death. Skeleton only.
- **Wall Euphyllia Prohibition:** Do not attempt to frag wall-type hammers—survival rate is near zero.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Post-Frag Carbon:** Run activated carbon after fragging to remove defensive chemicals released by the coral.
- **Amino Acid Supplementation:** Dosing amino acids supports tissue regeneration [TIER-3: Community].
