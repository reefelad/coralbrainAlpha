# Target Feeding Protocols

## Overview
Corals are mixotrophic organisms, meaning they derive energy from two distinct sources: autotrophy (photosynthesis via symbiotic zooxanthellae) and heterotrophy (predation and absorption). While lighting provides the glucose and "cellular fuel" for daily metabolism, it often lacks the nitrogen, phosphorus, and complex proteins required for tissue synthesis, repair, and rapid calcification. In the wild, corals are voracious predators, capturing zooplankton and suspended organic matter from the water column to satisfy their nutrient requirements.

Target feeding is the technical application of this biological necessity. It involves the precise delivery of nutrient-dense particles directly to the coral's oral disc or polyps. By bypassing broadcast feeding, target feeding maximizes the "energy return on investment" (EROI) for the coral, as the animal spends less energy on capture mechanisms relative to the nutritional yield. This precision also prevents the excessive accumulation of uneaten food, which can lead to bacterial blooms, oxygen depletion, and unwanted nutrient spikes (NO3/PO4) in the closed reef environment.

## Key Concepts

### Coral Capture Mechanisms
Corals utilize specialized biological tools to secure prey from the surrounding water:
*   **Nematocysts:** Sting-bearing cells on tentacles and the oral disc that paralyze micro-prey upon contact. [TIER-1: NIH/Peer-Reviewed]
*   **Mucociliary Transport:** Corals secrete a mucus net to trap particulates, which are then moved by hair-like cilia toward the mouth. This is the primary mechanism for corals with small polyps (SPS). [TIER-2: Living Oceans Foundation]
*   **Chemoreception:** Corals can "smell" amino acids and proteins in the water, triggering a feeding response (tentacle extension and oral disc swelling) even before food is present. [TIER-1: ResearchGate]

### Triton N-FUSE Crystalline Delivery
The Triton N-FUSE system represents an advanced evolution in target feeding. Instead of delivering loose particles that easily disperse, N-FUSE uses a two-part carrier to encapsulate food in a synthetic crystalline powder. This increases the density of the food particles, ensuring they settle directly on the coral polyps and remain there long enough for ingestion. This method claims to reduce food waste by up to 70%, significantly lowering the biological load on the filtration system. [TIER-1: Triton Official]

### Energy vs. Building Blocks
Predation is not just about "calories." It provides the specific building blocks (amino acids and vitamins) that photosynthesis cannot produce. In high-PAR environments, corals may have excess energy but still suffer from "nutrient starvation" if heterotrophic inputs are missing, leading to thin tissue and pale coloration.

## Practical Application

### Standard Target Feeding Protocol
1.  **Preparation:** Mix the chosen coral food (liquid or particulate) with a small amount of tank water.
2.  **Flow Control:** Reduce or turn off return pumps and wave makers. "Laminar creep" (very low flow) is often better than total stagnation to keep food suspended long enough for capture without blowing it away.
3.  **Delivery:** Using a syringe, pipette, or turkey baster, gently puff the food directly over the coral's polyps. Do not touch the coral with the tool to avoid triggering a defensive retraction.
4.  **Observation:** Wait 10–20 minutes for the coral to ingest the food before restoring full system flow.

### Triton N-FUSE Protocol
1.  **Phase 1:** Mix 10ml of N-FUSE Part 1 with 100ml of RODI water.
2.  **Phase 2:** Add nutrient supplements or particulate foods to the liquid.
3.  **Phase 3:** Add 10ml of N-FUSE Part 2. This triggers the formation of the crystalline carrier.
4.  **Dose:** Target feed the resulting mixture directly to corals.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Variable | Recommendation | Source |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Feeding Frequency | 1–3 times per week (typically) | [TIER-2: Red Sea] |
| Timing | 30-60 mins after lights-off (nocturnal hunters) | [TIER-2: BRS] |
| Wait Time (Flow Off) | 10–30 minutes | [TIER-3: R2R Consensus] |
| N-FUSE Frequency | Up to 3x weekly without consultation | [TIER-1: Triton] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Oxygen Demand:** Avoid target feeding immediately before a scheduled "lights-on" period if oxygen levels are low. Heterotrophic activity and bacterial decay consume O2.
*   **Ammonia/Nitrite:** Never feed more than what the system's bio-filter can process within 24 hours.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Flow Downtime:** Do not leave return pumps off for more than 60 minutes to prevent stagnation in the sump and potential heater/sensor issues.

**Additional Safety Notes:**
*   [VERIFY] Some corals (e.g., certain Scolymia) can "overeat" and experience internal rot if food portions are too large or frequent.
*   [GAP] Precise metabolic rates for different species in varied flow conditions are poorly documented; observation of "feeding response" remains the best gauge.
