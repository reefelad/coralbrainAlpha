# Amino Acids & Vitamins

## Overview
Amino acids and vitamins are the fundamental organic "molecular toolkits" required for coral vitality, structural integrity, and immune defense. While corals obtain the bulk of their metabolic energy (sugars) from their symbiotic zooxanthellae, they cannot build new tissue, repair damage, or produce complex pigments without a steady supply of nitrogen-rich amino acids and specific vitamin cofactors. In a reef environment, these are absorbed directly from the water column or ingested through prey.

Corals utilize amino acids not only for soft tissue growth but also to construct the **organic matrix**—the proteinaceous "glue" that binds calcium carbonate crystals together into a solid skeleton. Vitamins, particularly the B-complex and Vitamin C, serve as critical cofactors in metabolic pathways and immune responses. In the closed environment of an aquarium, managing the supply of these organics is a balance between providing enough for thriving growth and avoiding the "organic luxury" that leads to nuisance algae and cyanobacteria outbreaks.

## Key Concepts

### Protein Synthesis & The Organic Matrix
Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. In corals, specific amino acids like Aspartic Acid, Glutamic Acid, and Glycine are essential for the production of the skeletal organic matrix. This matrix acts as a template for calcification, meaning that skeletal strength and linear extension rates are directly influenced by amino acid availability. Without these building blocks, corals may produce "chalky" or brittle skeletons even in the presence of high alkalinity. [TIER-1: PNAS / Marine Biology Research]

### Direct Absorption Mechanisms
Unlike most animals, corals can absorb dissolved organic compounds (DOC) including amino acids directly from the water column through their epidermis. This is achieved via specialized carrier proteins (transporters) that actively move molecules against a concentration gradient. This allows corals to " scavenge" nutrients even in the extremely nutrient-poor (oligotrophic) waters of a healthy reef. [TIER-1: Coral Physiology Textbooks]

### Vitamin Cofactors & Immune Function
- **B-Complex Vitamins:** Essential for energy metabolism and cellular regeneration.
- **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid):** A powerful antioxidant that aids in tissue repair and collagen synthesis, particularly important after fragmentation or injury.
- **Vitamin E:** Protects cellular membranes from oxidative stress, particularly during high-light or high-temperature events. [TIER-2: Expert Consensus / BRS]

### The Triton Refugium as a Biogenerator
In the Triton methodology, the large-scale macroalgae refugium is viewed as a "living biogenerator" of organic molecules. As algae grow and undergo natural turnover, they release a complex spectrum of amino acids and vitamins into the water column. This natural release is often sufficient for balanced reef systems, reducing the need for "bottle-based" amino acid dosing which can be harder to control and often contains localized preservatives.

## Practical Application

### Dosing Protocols
- **ULNS (Ultra-Low Nutrient Systems):** In systems where Nitrate and Phosphate are near-zero, supplemental amino acid dosing is often critical to prevent coral tissue thinning (starvation).
- **Target Feeding vs. Broadcast:** Broadcast dosing is professional and mimics the natural reef's "batch" availability. Target feeding (soaking food in amino acids) is highly effective for individual colony recovery or growth boosting.
- **Automatic Dosing:** If dosing from a bottle, using a dosing pump to deliver small amounts throughout the day/night is superior to single large doses, as corals cannot store excess amino acids and will "waste" them into the water column where they fuel algae.

### Warning Signs of Overdosing
- **Cyanobacteria Outbreaks:** The most common sign of amino acid/vitamin overdose. Cyano can rapidly utilize simple organic compounds.
- **Darkening Tissue:** Excessive amino acids can cause zooxanthellae populations to skyrocket, leading to a "browned out" appearance as the algae mask the coral's natural pigments.
- **Film Algae on Glass:** Rapid accumulation of green film on the glass shortly after dosing.

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Oxygen Demand:** Rapid overdosing of concentrated amino acid solutions can trigger a bacterial bloom that consumes dissolved oxygen, potentially leading to fish and coral suffocation in poorly aerated systems.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Cyano Trigger:** If Cyanobacteria is present, immediately suspend all amino acid and vitamin dosing until the outbreak is resolved.
- **Preservative check:** Only use amino acid products specifically formulated for reef use; many human-grade vitamins contain preservatives or fillers (like copper in some B-complexes) that are lethal to invertebrates.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] The exact "ideal" ratio of specific amino acids for individual families (e.g., Acroporidae vs Euphylliidae) is not yet fully defined.
- [VERIFY] The extent to which high-wattage UV sterilizers degrade dissolved amino acids and vitamins before they can be absorbed by corals.
