# Visual Inspection & Dip (Pest Inspection)

## Overview

Visual Inspection and Chemical Dipping constitute the "Biological Firewall" of a modern reef system. This process is the primary defense against the introduction of devastating pathogens and parasites that can cause systematic failure in an established ecosystem. Biologically, the goal is to break the life cycle of hitchhikers—pests that have evolved to camouflage themselves perfectly within coral tissue or skeletal matrices.

A "Discovery First" perspective recognizes that the aquarium is an artificial concentration of biodiversity. In the wild, pests like Acropora-eating flatworms (AEFW) are kept in check by vast dilution and natural predators. In a closed system, these same organisms experience a population explosion due to the abundance of hosts and lack of natural controls. Dipping is not just a cleaning step; it is a proactive intervention to ensure the "Metabolic Debt" of the coral is not compounded by the energy drain of parasitic predation during the critical recovery phase.

## Key Concepts

### The "White Bowl" Protocol
Pest detection is significantly enhanced by using high-contrast backgrounds. By submerging a coral in a pure white container during the dip, common pests like AEFW (which are translucent/brown) or Red Bugs (tiny red specks) become visible as they are dislodged from the host.

### Chemical Disruption (The Dip)
Dips work by overstimulating or paralyzing the nervous systems of invertebrates (pests) without permanently damaging the more robust tissue of the coral host. Different chemicals target different biological pathways:
- **Oxidizers (Iodine):** Disrupt microbial membranes and provide mild antiseptic action. [TIER-1: Triton/Scientific Consensus]
- **Nervous System Disruptors (Pine oil/Essential oils):** Common in commercial dips like CoralRx or Revive to induce a "drop-off" response in flatworms and nudibranchs. [TIER-2]
- **Avermectins/Milbemycin:** Specifically target the glutamate-gated chloride channels in crustaceans (Red Bugs/Black Bugs). [TIER-2: Humble.Fish]

### The Egg-Cryptic Phase [GAP]
It is a critical biological fact that almost no reef-safe chemical dip is effective against the eggs of coral pests. Eggs are protected by a proteinaceous shield that is impervious to standard dipping concentrations. This means that a "clean" dip does not guarantee a clean coral; it only guarantees the removal of the current generation of adults. Eradication requires breaking the life cycle through repeated treatments based on known gestation periods. [TIER-1: Marine Biology Fundamentals]

### Mechanical Assistance (Basting)
The "HOW" of dipping must include mechanical action. High-velocity water movement, provided by a turkey baster or small powerhead, is necessary to physically dislodge pests that are stunned but still clinging to the coral's mucus layer or deep within the skeletal structure. [TIER-2]

## Practical Application

### 1. Step-by-Step Inspection & Dip
- **Step 1: Dry Inspection.** Before wetting, check the base of the coral for clusters of small, circular brown/purple eggs (AEFW or Nudibranch eggs).
- **Step 2: The Dip.** Submerge in the selected solution for 5-15 minutes (depending on manufacturer and coral sensitivity).
- **Step 3: Aggressive Basting.** Use a turkey baster to blow water into all crevices and the underside of the base.
- **Step 4: The Transfer Rinse.** Move the coral to a clean container of system water to rinse off any residual toxins before moving to quarantine.

### 2. Common Pests and Responses
- **AEFW:** Look for "bite marks" (white circular patches of missing tissue). Requires weekly dipping for 4-6 weeks to catch hatchlings.
- **Red/Black Bugs:** Tiny mites on Acropora. Requires specific treatments like Interceptor (Milbemycin) or intensive commercial dips.
- **MEN (Montipora Eating Nudibranchs):** White, branchy sea slugs. Usually found on the underside of Montipora. Check for white egg spirals.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Dip Type | Concentration (Standard) | Duration | Targeted Pest |
|----------|--------------------------|----------|---------------|
| Iodine-Based | 1-2 ml/L | 10-15 min | Bacteria / Mild Pests |
| Commercial (Revive/CoralRx) | Per Label | 5-10 min | Flatworms / Nudis |
| Bayer (Advanced) | 10-20 ml / Cup | 5-15 min | Comprehensive (Non-SPS safe if high) |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Personal Safety:** Many coral dips (especially Bayer or concentrated Iodine) are toxic to humans. Always wear gloves and eye protection.
- **Zero Sump Entry:** Never allow dip solution to enter the main aquarium or sumps. It will kill beneficial microfauna and potentially crash the system.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Sensitivity Testing:** Sensitive corals (Smooth skin Acropora, deepwater species) should be dipped for the minimum recommended time. If "sloughing" (tissue peeling) occurs, remove immediately.
- **Base Removal:** When possible, remove the coral from the shipping plug. Plugs are the primary site for egg deposition. [TIER-2]

## Interfaces
- **Connects to:** [11_acclimation_quarantine](acclimation_methods), [06_pests_diseases](common_pests)
- **Depends on:** Proper identification of host species sensitivity.
- **Informs:** Success of biosecurity protocols and long-term system stability.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] Comprehensive database of egg gestation periods for all known reef pests is incomplete.
- [VERIFY] Long-term impact of repeated chemical dipping on coral calcification rates post-transfer.
