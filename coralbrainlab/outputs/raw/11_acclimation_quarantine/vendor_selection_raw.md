# Vendor Selection & Ethical Sourcing

## Overview
The long-term stability of a Triton-based reef system begins long before livestock enters the aquarium. Every organism introduced is a potential vector for pathogens, pests, and chemical instability. **Vendor Selection** is the process of auditing the "Chain of Custody" to ensure that the livestock's journey from the reef (or farm) to the display tank has prioritized biological integrity over commercial speed.

From a **Discovery First** perspective, the quality of a vendor is measured by the **physiological resilience** of their livestock. Organisms that have been handled correctly—maintained in stable water chemistry, provided with adequate nutrition, and spared from toxic ammonia spikes during transit—arrive with robust immune systems. In contrast, poorly handled specimens often suffer from "Late-Onset Mortality," where they appear healthy for days but succumb to internal organ failure or opportunistic infections weeks later. Choosing vendors who align with the Triton philosophy of stability ensures that new additions contribute to, rather than detract from, the system's equilibrium.

## Key Concepts

### The Chain of Custody
Every hand that touches a fish or coral adds a layer of stress. The ideal chain is as short as possible:
1.  **Direct Sourcing (Tier-1):** Vendors who collect their own livestock or buy directly from mariculture facilities. They have the most control over handling.
2.  **Landed Wholesalers (Tier-2):** Large-scale importers who receive shipments and stabilize them before selling to retailers.
3.  **Local Fish Stores (LFS) / Online Retailers (Tier-3):** Facilities that holding livestock for final sale. Their value lies in their local acclimation and observation periods.

### Ethical Sourcing Tiers
Sourcing impact relates directly to the sustainability of the hobby and the health of the specimens:
- **Captive-Bred / Aquacultured [TIER-1]:** Born and raised in closed systems. These are the "gold standard" as they are already adapted to aquarium life, artificial diets, and carry the lowest pathogen risk.
- **Maricultured [TIER-2]:** Grown in ocean-based nurseries from fragments of wild colonies. They provide economic support to local island communities while reducing impact on natural reefs.
- **Sustainably Wild-Caught [TIER-2]:** Collected using net-only methods with CITES permits. Essential for species not yet bred in captivity.
- **Unverified Wild-Caught [TIER-3]:** Low-cost specimens with no handling history. High risk of cyanide use or poor post-capture care.

### Vendor Infrastructure Audit
A high-quality vendor should manifest "Stability over Numbers" in their own facility:
- **Dedicated Quarantine:** Separate systems for fish, corals, and invertebrates.
- **Prophylactic Treatment:** Use of copper, hyposalinity, or specific dips before sale.
- **Nutritional Support:** High-frequency feeding of nutrient-dense foods to rebuild metabolic reserves.
- **Transparency:** Willingness to share arrival dates, origin, and current water parameters.

## Practical Application

### The Vendor Audit Checklist
When evaluating a new vendor, ask the following:
1.  **"How long has this specimen been in your system?"** (Minimum 7-14 days for fish is preferred).
2.  **"What is your current salinity and pH?"** (Matches should be close to your own to reduce acclimation stress).
3.  **"Was this fish eating upon arrival?"** (Specifically ask what it is eating now).
4.  **"Do you use copper or UV in your holding systems?"** (Knowing this informs your own quarantine strategy).

### Red Flags to Avoid
- **"Fresh Arrivals":** Buying fish the day they arrive from the wholesaler is extremely high risk (the "Double Stress" event).
- **Consolidation Systems:** Vendors who mix new arrivals with established livestock without separation.
- **Poor Husbandry Signs:** Dead specimens in tanks, algae-choked systems, or listless livestock.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Vendor Type | Best For | Pathogen Risk | Pricing Tier |
|-------------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Specialist Boutique** | Rare SPS, High-end Fish | Low (due to long QT) | Premium |
| **Wholesale Outlet** | Value, Common Species | High (due to high turnover) | Low |
| **LFS (Local)** | Visual selection, immediate pickup | Variable | Mid-Range |
| **Online Direct** | Specificity, Maricultured corals | Medium | Variable |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **CITES Compliance:** Never purchase protected species (e.g., certain stony corals) without verifying legal CITES documentation. Illegal trade threatens the entire hobby's future.
- **Cyanide-Free Guarantee:** Only buy from vendors who commit to net-caught or captive-bred fish. Cyanide destroys the internal organs of fish, leading to inevitable death weeks later.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Assume Every Wild Specimen is a Carrier:** Regardless of vendor claims, always treat wild-caught livestock as having potential parasites (Ich, Velvet, or Flukes).
- **Verify "Pre-Quarantined" Claims:** If a vendor charges extra for "Fully Quarantined" fish, request their specific protocol and duration.

## Interfaces

- **Depends on:** [06_pests_diseases] (Identifying vendor health issues), [10_testing_protocols] (Verifying vendor water parameters).
- **Informs:** [38_compliance] (Legal and ethical standards).

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] Lack of a universal "Vendor Health Certification" standard in the marine hobby.
- [VERIFY] Long-term survival rates of "Drop-Shipped" livestock vs. facility-acclimated livestock.
- [GAP] Impact of different mariculture substrates on coral microbiome transition to closed systems.
