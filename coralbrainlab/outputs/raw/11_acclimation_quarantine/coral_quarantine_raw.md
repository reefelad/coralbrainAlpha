# Coral Quarantine Setup

## Overview
A dedicated coral quarantine (QT) system is a fundamental biological "airlock" designed to protect the display ecosystem from invasive pests, pathogens, and unwanted algae. While chemical dips are effective against many active pests, they are notoriously unreliable against eggs—which are often protected by calcified substrates or buried within the coral's structure—and have no impact on viral or bacterial pathogens that may be present in the transport water.

From a **Discovery First** perspective, quarantine is the process of metabolic observation and secondary detoxification. It allows the coral to stabilize from the stress of shipping in a controlled environment where its health can be monitored without the competition of a full reef. Crucially, it provides the required 30-70 day window to interrupt the life cycles of pests like Acropora-eating flatworms (AEFW) or Montipora-eating nudibranchs, which may hatch weeks after the initial dip. In a Triton-based system, maintaining the same water quality baseline in the QT as the display ensures that the eventual move is a "non-event" for the coral's physiology.

## Key Concepts

### Fragment Isolation & Observation
The primary goal of the QT is not just isolation, but active observation. Pests like AEFW are master mimics, often appearing as subtle discolorations or "bite marks" on the base of a coral that only become visible under consistent, close-up lighting.
- **Protocol:** Daily visual audits using a magnifying glass or macro photography. 
- **Duration:** 45-70 days is the gold standard, covering the full life cycle of most known reef pests.

### Baseline Parameter Alignment
To minimize "double acclimation" stress, the quarantine tank should be kept at the same parameters as the target display tank (specifically Salinity, Alkalinity, and Temperature). 
- **Triton Integration:** Ideally, the QT utilizes the same salt mix and dosing regime (on a smaller scale) to match the ICP-verified baseline of the display.

### Mechanical and Biological Barriers
A coral QT is typically "slick" (no sand or live rock) to prevent pests from hiding in the substrate and to avoid the absorption of medications by porous materials.
- **Bio-filtration:** Ceramic media or sponge filters pre-colonized in the display sump provide immediate biological stability without the risk of harboring hitchhikers.
- **Aerosol Isolation:** The QT should be physically distant from the display (minimum 3-5 meters) to prevent cross-contamination from splashing or aerosolized parasites (e.g., Amyloodinium).

## Practical Application

### Quarantine Tank Configuration
1.  **Tank:** 40-75L shallow aquarium for easy access and light penetration.
2.  **Filtration:** Hang-on-back (HOB) or internal sponge filter for aeration and waste removal.
3.  **Lighting:** Medium-output LED (matching the primary display spectrum) to prevent light shock or starvation.
4.  **Flow:** Small powerhead providing laminar flow to prevent detritus accumulation.
5.  **Frag Racks:** Egg-crate or acrylic racks to keep corals off the bottom and allow flow through the structure.

### The "Transfer Rinse" Protocol
Before moving a coral from QT to the display:
1.  **Secondary Dip:** One final chemical dip to catch any late hatchers.
2.  **Scrub and Inspect:** Physically scrub the base of the coral or the plug with a toothbrush.
3.  **Clean Water Rinse:** Move to a bucket of clean tank water before final placement.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Parameter | Recommended Range | Source |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Salinity | 34-35 ppt | [TIER-1] |
| Temperature | 24-26°C | [TIER-1] |
| Alkalinity | 7.5-8.5 dKH | [TIER-1] |
| Duration | 45 - 72 Days | [TIER-2] |
| Light Intensity | 50% - 75% of Display | [TIER-2] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Isolation Purity:** Never share equipment (nets, scapers, hands) between the QT and the display without sterilization. A single drop of water can transfer *Ich* or *Velvet* dinos.
- **Medication Limits:** Never dose copper or other heavy metal medications in a system that will ever house corals or invertebrates. These are lethal to the holobiont.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Water Consistency:** Use water from the main display for QT water changes to ensure parameter matching, provided the display is verified pathogen-free.
- **Pest Eggs:** Assume all frag plugs harbor eggs. If a coral cannot be removed from its plug, the quarantine time MUST exceed 70 days.

## Interfaces

- **Depends on:** [11_acclimation_quarantine] (Initial entry), [13_system_design] (Plumbing/Isolation).
- **Informs:** [04_coral_biology] (Long-term health monitoring).

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] Scientific verification of the exact "dormancy" period for many emerging soft-coral pests.
- [VERIFY] Efficiency of UV sterilization in small QT setups for preventing pest spread between corals in the same tank.
- [GAP] Impact of "bare-bottom" environments on the development of the coral's bacterial slime layer.
