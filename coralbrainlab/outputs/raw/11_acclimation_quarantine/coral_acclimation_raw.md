# Coral Acclimation & Pest Dipping

## Overview
Corals are highly specialized organisms that have evolved to thrive in the ultra-stable environments of tropical reefs. When a coral is moved from a vendor's system, through shipping, and into a home aquarium, it undergoes a series of **metabolic shocks**. The primary purpose of acclimation is not just to match water parameters, but to manage the biological stress of transition. A coral that is not properly acclimated may suffer from photo-inhibition (light shock), osmotic stress, or the introduction of devastating "hitchhiker" pests that can collapse an entire ecosystem.

From a **Discovery First** perspective, acclimation is the process of gently re-aligning the coral's internal chemical balance (its holobiont and zooxanthellae population) with the new environment. While fish require a "biological firewall" (quarantine), corals require a "chemical firewall" (pest dipping) and a "radiant transition" (light acclimation). In the Triton Method, where stability is the ultimate goal, these procedures ensure that new additions strengthen the system rather than introducing instability.

## Key Concepts

### Pest Dipping: The Chemical Firewall
The introduction of a single "flatworm" or "nudibranch" can lead to a colony-wide infestation. Pests like Acropora Eating Flatworms (AEFW) or Montipora Eating Nudibranchs have no natural predators in most home systems and can consume tissue faster than it can grow.
- **Mechanism:** Dipping involves placing the coral in a concentrated solution of botanical or chemical insecticides (e.g., Pine oil, Citrus extracts, or Iodine-based dips).
- **Limitations:** Most dips kill adult pests but **do not kill eggs**. This necessitates manual inspection and potentially repeated dipping protocols.

### Light Acclimation: Preventing Photo-Inhibition
Corals utilize zooxanthellae to produce energy from light. If a coral moved from a low-PAR environment (e.g., a shipping box or a dim holding tank) is suddenly placed under high-intensity LEDs, the zooxanthellae can over-produce oxygen radicals, damaging the coral's tissue and leading to "bleaching" (expulsion of zooxanthellae).
- **Strategy:** Start the coral at the bottom of the tank and move it upward over 1-2 weeks, or use a programmed "acclimation mode" on the aquarium controller to gradually increase light intensity.

### Osmotic Shock and Drip Acclimation
Unlike fish, corals are generally tolerant of minor salinity shifts, but they are sensitive to rapid osmotic changes.
- **Drip Acclimation:** Slowly adding tank water to the shipping water over 30-60 minutes.
- **Dry/Quick Method:** Some experts recommend a quick temperature match and immediate dip, arguing that the time spent in stagnant shipping water is more harmful than the osmotic shift.

## Practical Application

### The 4-Step Standard Protocol
1.  **Temperature Match:** Float the sealed bag in the display or sump for 15-20 minutes.
2.  **Pest Dip:** 
    - Use a dedicated container with tank water.
    - Add the recommended dose of dip (e.g., CoralRX, Revive, or 10% Iodine).
    - Use a Turkey Baster to gently blow water into the coral's polyps to dislodge pests.
    - **Time:** 5–10 minutes (refer to product label).
3.  **Rinse:** Move the coral to a second container with clean tank water to remove residual dip chemicals. Never allow dip to enter the display tank.
4.  **Placement:** Place the coral on the sand bed or in a low-light area for the first 3-5 days.

### Manual Inspection (The "Egg Hunt")
Before placing the coral, use a magnifying glass to inspect the "plug" or the coral's base for eggs. Eggs often appear as small brown, white, or clear clusters.
- **Action:** If eggs are found, scrape them off with a scalpel or cover the entire area with cyanoacrylate (super glue) to smother them.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Parameter | Threshold for Action | Note | Source |
|-----------|----------------------|------|--------|
| Temp Delta | > 2°C | Float required | [TIER-2] |
| Salinity Delta | > 2 ppt | Drip acclimation recommended | [TIER-2] |
| Dip Duration | > 15 mins | Can cause tissue damage; follow labels | [TIER-2] |
| Initial PAR | < 100 µmol/m²/s | Safe starting point for most corals | [TIER-1] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Dip Toxicity:** Never add coral dips directly to the display tank. These chemicals are designed to kill invertebrates and will kill your beneficial microfauna and other corals in the system.
- **Temperature Limits:** Never acclimate if the shipping water is below 20°C or above 30°C without stabilizing it first; extreme shock can cause immediate RTN.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Avoid Shared Dips:** Never reuse a dip for multiple corals from different sources to avoid cross-contamination.
- **SPS Sensitivity:** Small Polyp Stony (SPS) corals are generally more sensitive to dips than LPS or Softies. Monitor closely for "tissue sloughing" during the dip.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] Long-term efficacy of "Bayer" dips vs. specialized reef-safe botanical dips for emerging pests like Kalloprion (Fireworms).
- [VERIFY] Impact of dipping on the coral's native bacterial microbiome (holobiont).
