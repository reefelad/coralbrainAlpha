# Fish Quarantine Protocols

## Overview
Quarantine is the single most important practice for long-term reef stability that occurs *outside* the display tank. In the wild, marine fish inhabit vast volumes of water where the dilution of pathogens is near-infinite. When these animals are introduced to the closed system of an aquarium, the biological "load" of parasites like Cryptocaryon irritans (Marine Ich) or Amyloodinium (Marine Velvet) can rapidly reach lethal concentrations. The primary purpose of a quarantine tank (QT) is to act as a **biological firewall**, ensuring that these pathogens are identified and eliminated before they can infect the established display population.

Beyond disease prevention, quarantine provides a low-stress environment for **metabolic acclimation**. New arrivals are often stressed from transport and may have suppressed immune systems. A dedicated QT allows the aquarist to focus on establishing a strong feeding response and slowly adjusting the fish's physiology to the specific water chemistry of the home system without competition from established, aggressive tank mates. In the context of the Triton Method, which prioritizes biological balance and high-value livestock, a rigorous quarantine protocol is considered a mandatory safeguard.

## Key Concepts

### The Observational vs. Prophylactic Debate
There are two primary schools of thought regarding quarantine:
1.  **Observational:** The fish is kept in a clean environment and monitored for symptoms. Treatment is only administered if a specific disease is identified. This minimizes chemical stress but carries the risk of subclinical infections (pathogens present but not visible) entering the display.
2.  **Prophylactic:** The fish is treated with a standard "battery" of medications (e.g., Copper, Praziquantel, Antibiotics) regardless of visible symptoms. This is more aggressive and ensures a higher "sterile" rate but can be stressful for sensitive species like Wrasses or Mandarins.

### The "Fallow" Principle
Understanding the life cycle of marine parasites is critical. If a pathogen enters the display tank, it can often only be eliminated by removing all fish hosts for a specific "fallow period" (typically 76 days for Ich). Effective quarantine *prevents* the need for this catastrophic intervention. Stability is maintained by ensuring the display remains a closed system to pathogens.

### Triton Method Non-Interference
A critical Triton-specific rule is that **quarantine must be a completely separate system**. Never use a refugium or a section of the sump as a quarantine area. The presence of therapeutic chemicals (like Copper) or the high organic load of a QT would disrupt the delicate biological balance and trace element profile of the Triton system.

## Practical Application

### The Bare-Bottom Protocol
A standard QT should be simple to facilitate sterilization:
- **Tank:** 40L to 80L (10-20 gallon) is usually sufficient.
- **Filtration:** Simple sponge filter (seeded with bacteria from the main system *only if* the main system is known to be clean).
- **Hides:** PVC pipe sections (non-porous, easy to clean). No sand or rock, as these can absorb medications like Copper.
- **Lighting:** Dim or ambient lighting to reduce stress.

### Phased Acclimation (21-30 Days)
- **Week 1:** Observation and establishment of feeding. Use high-quality foods (Mysis, Brine enriched with vitamins).
- **Week 2:** Prophylactic treatment or continued observation. Freshwater dips (5 minutes) can be used to check for flukes.
- **Week 3-4:** Final observation and gradual adjustment of salinity/temperature to match the display tank precisely.

### Common Therapeutics
- **Copper (Cupramine/Copper Power):** The gold standard for Ich and Velvet. Requires precise testing (Hanna Checker) to maintain therapeutic levels without reaching toxicity.
- **Praziquantel (Prazipro):** Targets flukes and internal worms. Generally reef-safe but should still be used in QT.
- **Formalin:** Used for aggressive parasites like Brooklynella or Uronema (common in Clownfish/Chromis).

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Parameter | Target Range (QT) | Note | Source |
|-----------|-------------------|------|--------|
| Temperature | 25°C - 27°C | Match display exactly before transfer | [TIER-2] |
| Salinity | 35 ppt (1.026 SG) | Lowering to 1.009 (Hyposalinity) is a treatment option | [TIER-1] |
| Ammonia | 0 ppm | Critical in small tanks; use "Ammonia Alert" badges | [TIER-2] |
| Copper | 0.5 - 2.5 ppm | Depends on brand (Chelated vs. Ionic) | [TIER-2] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Zero Cross-Contamination:** Never share nets, siphons, or even wet hands between the QT and the display. A single drop of water can transfer Ich tomonts.
- **Ammonia Management:** Small tanks without established biological filtration can see lethal ammonia spikes within hours of feeding. Immediate water changes (50%+) are required if ammonia is detected.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Copper Sensitivity:** Sensitize delicate fish (Wrasses, Anthias) to copper slowly over 48-72 hours rather than dumping the full dose at once.
- **Separate Equipment:** All QT equipment (nets, buckets, heaters) must be color-coded and kept physically separate from display equipment.
