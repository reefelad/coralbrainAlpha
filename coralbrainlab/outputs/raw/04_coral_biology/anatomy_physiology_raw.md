# Coral Anatomy & Physiology

## Overview
Corals are complex colonial organisms that exist as a delicate "meta-organism"—a symbiotic partnership between a host animal (the cnidarian polyp) and photosynthetic algae (zooxanthellae) living within its tissues. Understanding coral anatomy is the foundation of advanced reef-keeping because every external parameter we manage—from lighting to trace elements—interacts directly with specific biological structures. The health of a reef system is essentially the sum of the health of these microscopic tissue layers. [TIER-1: NOAA]

At its most fundamental level, a coral is a living interface. The outer tissue layers manage gas exchange and nutrient capture, while the internal layers facilitate the energetic partnership with algae and the construction of the calcium carbonate skeleton. By understanding the "why" behind coral structures—such as why a polyp extends or how it builds its skeleton—aquaculturists can move from reactive maintenance to predictive husbandry, identifying subtle changes in tissue density or polyp behavior before they manifest as critical failures.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Tri-Layer Tissue System
The coral polyp body wall consists of three primary layers, each with distinct physiological roles:
*   **Ectoderm (Epidermis):** The outermost layer in direct contact with seawater. It contains specialized cells for defense and feeding (nematocytes), mucus-secreting cells for protection and waste removal, and sensory cells. [TIER-1: NOAA]
*   **Gastroderm (Gastrodermis):** The innermost layer lining the gastrovascular cavity. This is the "engine room" where the majority of zooxanthellae reside, facilitating nutrient exchange and digestion. [TIER-1: Marine Biology Journals]
*   **Mesoglea:** A jelly-like, non-cellular matrix between the ectoderm and gastroderm. It provides structural support and serves as a medium for the migration of cells and nutrients between layers. [TIER-1: NOAA]

### 2. The Polyp & Coelenteron
A coral colony is a collection of genetically identical polyps connected by a thin layer of tissue called the **coenosarc**. 
*   **Mouth/Anus:** A single opening serves both for ingestion and waste expulsion.
*   **Tentacles & Nematocysts:** Specialized stinging cells (nematocysts) within the tentacles allow corals to capture prey and defend territory against encroaching neighbors. [TIER-1: NOAA]
*   **Gastrovascular Cavity (Coelenteron):** A central sac where digestion occurs. It is also the site of hydrostatic pressure management, allowing polyps to "inflate" or "deflate" through water movement. [TIER-2: BRS Investigates]

### 3. Biomineralization & The Calicodermis
The process of skeletal growth (calcification) occurs at the base of the polyp in a specialized region of the ectoderm known as the **calicodermis** (or calicoblastic epithelium). [TIER-1: Biomineralization Research]
*   **Calicoblasts:** These cells actively pump calcium and carbonate ions into the sub-calicoblastic space (the tiny gap between tissue and skeleton).
*   **Organic Matrix:** Corals secrete a protein-rich framework that guides the precipitation of aragonite crystals.
*   **Energy Consumption:** Biomineralization is metabolically expensive, requiring significant ATP (energy) derived from both photosynthesis and heterotrophic feeding. [TIER-2: Triton Official]

### 4. Colony Morphologies: SPS vs. LPS
While the basic anatomy is similar, the "strategy" differs between types:
*   **Small Polyp Stony (SPS):** High tissue-to-skeleton surface area ratio. Dependent mostly on high light and high flow to facilitate gas exchange across thin tissue layers. [TIER-2: BRS Investigates]
*   **Large Polyp Stony (LPS):** Higher tissue volume. Often capable of capturing larger prey and utilizing water inflation (hydrostatic pressure) for surface area expansion. [TIER-2: Tidal Gardens]

## Practical Application

### Identifying Health via Polyp Extension
Polyp extension (PE) is a primary bio-indicator. 
*   **Daytime PE:** Often indicates favorable conditions for gas exchange and light capture.
*   **Nighttime PE:** Primarily for heterotrophic feeding (capturing plankton).
*   **Zero PE:** May indicate Stress (excessive flow, chemical irritants, or predation by pests). [TIER-2: Reef2Reef Expert Consensus]

### Tissue Density & Receding
"Tight" tissue (where the skeleton is visible through thin skin) often indicates nutrient deficiency or light stress. Rapid Tissue Necrosis (RTN) or Slow Tissue Necrosis (STN) occurs when the delicate bond between the calicodermis and the skeleton is severed, usually due to bacterial infection or extreme alkalinity swings. [TIER-1: Triton Detox Protocols]

### Fragging Safety
When "fragging" (asexual propagation), cutting through the coenosarc or skeletal structure creates an open wound. The coral relies on its mesoglea and gastroderm to seal the wound and prevent infection. Rapid healing requires stable alkalinity and sufficient trace elements (like Iodine and Zinc) for tissue repair. [TIER-2: WWC/Tidal Gardens]

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Component | Function | Maintenance Priority | Source |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|--------|
| **Zooxanthellae** | Energy Production | High (Light/Nutrient Balance) | [TIER-1] |
| **Calicodermis** | Skeletal Growth | High (Alk/Ca Stability) | [TIER-1] |
| **Nematocysts** | Defense/Feeding | Medium (Trace Element Support) | [TIER-2] |
| **Coenosarc** | Colony Communication| Medium (Flow/Pathogen Control) | [TIER-1] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Alkalinity Stability:** Swings >2.0 dKH/day can trigger "alk burn" where the calicodermis separates from the skeleton, leading to RTN. [TIER-1: Triton Baseline]
*   **Temperature Extremes:** Temperatures >32°C cause the expulsion of zooxanthellae (Bleaching), severing the core physiological partnership. [TIER-1: NOAA]

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Trace Element Balance:** Elements like Iodine and Manganese are critical for the metabolic health of coral tissues; deficiency leads to lack of "glow" (pigmentation) and reduced disease resistance. [TIER-2: Triton Core7]

## Interfaces
*   **Connects to:** 02_Lighting (Photosynthesis), 01_Water_Chemistry (Calcification).
*   **Depends on:** 03_Flow_Hydrodynamics (Gas exchange and waste removal).
*   **Informs:** 06_Pests_Diseases (Identifying symptoms of infection vs. stress).

## Gaps / Open Questions
*   **[GAP]:** The exact mechanism by which different coral species coordinate colony-wide responses (like Synchronized Spawning) via the coenosarc is still partially unknown.
*   **[VERIFY]:** The extent to which "Coral Fluorescent Proteins" (CFPs) act strictly as sunscreens vs. metabolic byproducts is still debated in current marine biology. [CONFLICT]
