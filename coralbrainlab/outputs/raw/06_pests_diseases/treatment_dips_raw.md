# Treatment Dips & Baths

## Overview
Corals have evolved complex biological defenses against pests and pathogens, but when moved into the artificial environment of a reef aquarium, they often encounter concentrated populations of specialized parasites. Understanding the biological vulnerability of these pests is the key to effective treatment. Coral "dips" are targeted chemical or osmotic sessions designed to exploit these vulnerabilities while preserving the coral’s own tissues.

The primary mechanism of a dip is to create an environment that is lethal to the parasite's nervous system or cellular structure, but within the stress-tolerance threshold of the coral animal. For example, osmotic shock (freshwater or hypersaline) leverages the difference in pressure to rupture pest cells, whereas neurotoxins (pinewood oil, plant-based soaps, or certain insecticides) target the locomotive abilities of pests like Acropora-eating flatworms or Red Bugs. Iodine-based dips provide an additional benefit of acting as a broad-spectrum antiseptic, assisting in tissue repair and preventing opportunistic bacterial infections like *Vibrio* from colonizing stressed or damaged areas.

## Key Concepts

### Osmotic Pressure Manipulation
Parasites and pests often lack the advanced osmoregulation capabilities of the corals they inhabit. Exposing a coral to a brief bath of different salinity (low-salinity or freshwater for certain hardy corals like Zoanthids) creates an osmotic gradient that causes the pest's cells to absorb or release water rapidly, leading to detachment or cellular failure.

### Oxidative Disinfection (Hydrogen Peroxide)
Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) acts as a powerful oxidizer, reacting aggressively with organic biofilms, algae, and the delicate tissues of certain pests. Corals naturally produce small amounts of H2O2 as a defense mechanism; external application leverages this to "burn" away pests and nuisance algae from frag plugs.

### Neurotoxic Inhibition (Botanicals & Insecticides)
Botanicals like pine oil (Revive) or tea tree oil, and concentrated insecticides (Bayer/Cyfluthrin), work by disrupting the nervous system of complex pests. These agents inhibit the pest's ability to grip the coral tissue, allowing them to be blown off with gentle flow.

### Antiseptic & Tissue Healing (Iodine)
Iodine (Lugol’s or commercial dips) is a vital trace element for coral health. In high concentrations (dips), it serves as an antiseptic that halts the spread of bacterial infections and provides the raw material needed for rapid tissue regeneration after a pest has been removed.

## Practical Application
*   **Acclimation Protocol:** Every new coral should receive a proactive dip to ensure no hitchhikers enter the system.
*   **Targeted Treatment:** Match the dipping agent to the specific pest (e.g., Iodine for LPS/Zoanthids, Bayer/Revive for SPS).
*   **Double Rinsing:** Always use two separate rinse containers of clean tank water to ensure no residual dipping agent enters the main display.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables
| Dip Type | Exposure Time | Target | Source |
|-----------|---------------|--------|--------|
| Iodine-based | 10-15 Min | Bacterial / Antiseptic | [TIER-1] |
| Pine Oil / Botanical | 10 Min | General Pests (Detachment) | [TIER-2] |
| Hydrogen Peroxide (3%) | 1-3 Min (Plug only best) | Algae / Biofilm | [TIER-2] |
| Osmotic (Freshwater) | <60 Sec | Zoanthid / Pest specific | [TIER-3] |

## Safety Considerations
⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Temperature Stability:** The dip water must be maintained at the same temperature as the display tank (+/- 1°C) to avoid thermal shock on top of chemical stress.
- **pH Stability:** Dip water should be buffered to match the display tank pH.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Mucus Monitoring:** If a coral shows excessive stringy mucus or begins to bleach during a dip, remove it immediately.
- **Toxicity:** Insecticides (Bayer) are extremely toxic to crustaceans (shrimp/crabs). Ensure zero carry-over into the display tank.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] The long-term impact of systemic insecticide absorption by coral tissue remains under-researched.
- [VERIFY] Specific H2O2 concentrations for sensitive SPS varieties (Acropora).
