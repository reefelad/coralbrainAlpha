# Disease Identification (RTN/STN)

## Overview

Corals are complex meta-organisms where the animal host, symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), and a diverse microbiome exist in a delicate balance. When this balance is disrupted by environmental stress, pathogenic invasion, or chemical imbalances, the coral's immune system can fail, leading to Rapid Tissue Necrosis (RTN) or Slow Tissue Necrosis (STN). These conditions represent a "systemic failure" of the coral's biological integrity, where tissue loses its attachment to the calcium carbonate skeleton and sloughs off, often leaving behind a pristine white skeleton.

In the Triton methodology, RTN and STN are viewed not just as isolated infections, but as symptoms of environmental or elemental instability. While pathogens (such as *Vibrio* bacteria or *Philaster* parasites) are the immediate executioners of tissue death, the root cause often lies in the breakdown of the coral's "biological sanctuary." Maintaining precise elemental ratios (particularly Trace Elements like Bromine, Barium, and Fluorine) and metabolic stability (N-DOC) is the primary defense against these devastating events.

## Key Concepts

### Rapid Tissue Necrosis (RTN)
RTN is characterized by the swift loss of coral tissue, often occurring within 24 hours. The tissue literally "falls off" or dissolves, leaving a stark white skeleton. It is frequently triggered by acute stressors such as extreme temperature spikes (>32°C), severe alkalinity swings (>2.0 dKH/day), or the introduction of highly virulent pathogens.

### Slow Tissue Necrosis (STN)
STN progresses over days, weeks, or even months, typically starting from the base of the colony and moving upward. It is often a sign of chronic stress, such as chronic trace element deficiency (e.g., extremely low Barium or Bromine), light starvation, or a persistent but less aggressive microbial imbalance.

### Pathogenic Drivers
Specific microorganisms have been linked to necrosis:
- **Parasites:** Ciliates like *Philaster lucinda* and *Philaster guamense* are strongly associated with RTN, consuming coral tissue and zooxanthellae. [TIER-2: Prime Coral Research]
- **Bacteria:** *Vibrio* species are opportunistic pathogens that overwhelm corals when their immune systems are compromised by stress. [TIER-1: Marine Microbiology Journals]

### The "Triton Element" Connection
Triton research has identified specific elemental correlations with tissue health:
- **Bromine (Br):** Targets 60-70 ppm. Levels below 50 ppm correlate with poor polyp expansion and faded colors; levels above 90 ppm can trigger tissue detachment (necrosis). [TIER-1: Triton Lab]
- **Barium (Ba):** While required in minute amounts, extremely low barium correlates with RTN/STN outbreaks. Conversely, toxic levels (>140 ppb) also cause tissue loss. [TIER-1: Triton Lab]
- **Fluorine (F):** Targets 1.0-1.2 ppm. Essential for skeletal vitality and the calcification process; deficiency weakens the host-skeleton bond. [TIER-1: Triton Lab]

## Practical Application

### Visual Diagnosis
- **RTN Check:** Look for "snow-like" sloughing tissue or a white "peeled" appearance on SPS corals. The progression is visible hour-by-hour.
- **STN Check:** Look for a receding "tide line" at the base of the coral. The exposed skeleton may begin to grow algae (green or brown) if the necrosis is slow enough.
- **Microbial Clue:** Brown jelly-like masses (Brown Jelly Syndrome) indicate a secondary infection by ciliates and bacteria feeding on the dying tissue.

### Immediate Action Protocol
1. **Targeted Fragging:** For localized necrosis on a colony, cut the coral at least 15-20mm (0.5 - 0.75 inches) into *healthy* tissue. Discard the necrotic portion and the immediate "transition zone."
2. **Pathogen Reduction:** Use localized dips (e.g., Prime Coral Stop RTN, Coral Rx, or Lugol's Iodine) to reduce microbial and parasitic load.
3. **Parameter Stabilization:** Check and stabilize temperature and alkalinity. Avoid large corrections during an active outbreak.
4. **Water Chemistry Audit:** Perform an ICP-OES test to check for trace element deficiencies (Bromine, Barium, Fluorine) or toxicities (Barium, heavy metals).

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Parameter | Target Range | Critical Threshold | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Bromine** | 60 - 70 ppm | < 50 or > 90 ppm | Prevents spontaneous tissue detachment [TIER-1] |
| **Barium** | < 100 ppb | > 140 ppb | High levels are toxic to coral tissue [TIER-1] |
| **Fluorine** | 1.0 - 1.2 ppm | < 0.8 ppm | Supports skeletal-tissue bonding [TIER-1] |
| **Temp Swing** | < 1°C / day | > 2°C / day | Acute thermal shock triggers RTN [TIER-1] |
| **Alk Swing** | < 0.5 dKH/day | > 2.0 dKH/day | Metabolic shock triggers RTN [TIER-1] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Alkalinity Change:** Never exceed 2.0 dKH change within 24 hours. Rapid increases in carbonate can trigger immediate RTN in settled SPS colonies.
- **Heavy Metals:** Presence of Copper (Cu), Tin (Sn), or Lead (Pb) even at ppb levels can cause systemic necrosis.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Bromine Overdose:** Do not supplement Bromine without ICP verification; excessive levels are as dangerous as deficiencies.
- **GFO Impact:** Rapid introduction of large amounts of GFO (Granular Ferric Oxide) has been linked to RTN, likely due to rapid drops in PO4 or trace element stripping.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] The exact mechanism of Barium in coral metabolism remains largely theoretical despite observed correlations.
- [VERIFY] The efficacy of in-tank "RTN blockers" vs. traditional fragging and stabilization.
- [GAP] Viral role in RTN/STN is significantly under-researched in aquaculture settings.
