# Parameter Interactions

## Overview
A reef aquarium is not a spreadsheet where each cell is independent. It is a dynamic biological web where changing one variable inevitably shifts others. "Parameter Interactions" is the study of these relationships. Understanding them prevents the common rookie mistake of chasing a single number while destabilizing the entire system.

The holobiont (coral + algae + bacteria) sits at the center of this web. Its health depends not just on the *presence* of inputs (Elements, Light, Food) but on the *balance* between them.

## Key Concepts

### The Alkalinity-pH-CO2 Triangle
Alkalinity and pH are chemically locked.
*   **The Buffer:** Alkalinity is the water's ability to neutralize acid. Higher alkalinity typically supports a higher, more stable pH.
*   **CO2 Impact:** Even with high alkalinity, high dissolved CO2 (from indoor air or biological respiration) will depress pH.
*   **Calcification Cost:** Biological calcification is metabolically "cheaper" at higher pH. Low pH stress increases the demand for energy, making corals more sensitive to other stressors.

### The Temperature-Metabolism-Oxygen Link
Temperature controls the speedometer of life.
*   **Metabolic Demand:** As temperature rises, coral metabolism accelerates. Demand for Alkalinity, Calcium, and Nutrients increases.
*   **Oxygen Availability:** Crucially, warm water holds *less* oxygen than cool water. So as temperature spirals up, corals need *more* oxygen to support faster metabolism, but the water provides *less*. This "respiratory squeeze" is a primary mechanism of bleaching mortality.

### The Light-Nutrient Balance
Light is the accelerator; Nutrients are the fuel.
*   **High Light / Low Nutrients:** The car is flooring the gas with no fuel. Result: The engine burns out (Bleaching / Pale Tips / STN).
*   **Low Light / High Nutrients:** The car has fuel but no gas. Result: The engine floods (Browning / Algae blooms).
*   **The Sweet Spot:** High-energy systems (High PAR) require elevated nutrients (NO3/PO4) to protect the coral tissue from oxidative stress.

### The Magnesium-Calcium-Alk Lock
Magnesium is the "referee" of the foundation elements.
*   **Interference:** Magnesium ions physcially interfere with the crystal lattice of Calcium Carbonate, preventing it from precipitating abiotically.
*   **Diagnosis:** If you cannot raise Calcium or Alkalinity despite dosing (it precipitates as "snow"), check Magnesium. It is likely too low.

## Practical Application

### Troubleshooting Flowchart
1.  **Tissue Necrosis (STN/RTN)?** Check Alkalinity Stability first. Then check for "Burnt Tips" (High Light + Low Nutrients).
2.  **Lack of Growth?** Check pH (chronically low?) or Phosphate (too high inhibiting calcification?).
3.  **Precipitation on heaters/pumps?** Check Magnesium (too low?) or pH (too high via Kalkwasser?).

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

### Ratios
| Interaction | Guidelines | Source |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Redfield Ratio (N:P) | ~16:1 Atomic (~100:1 NO3:PO4 often tolerated in reef) | [TIER-2] |
| Mg:Ca Ratio | ~3:1 (e.g., 1350 Mg to 450 Ca) | [TIER-2] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Hypoxia Risk:** In a power outage, temperature drop is safer than temperature spike. A spike depletes oxygen rapidly when pumps are off.
*   **Ammonia Toxicity:** pH affects ammonia toxicity. Higher pH makes Ammonia ($NH_3$) more toxic than Ammonium ($NH_4^+$). Be careful raising pH during a crash/cycle.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Change One Thing:** Never try to fix multiple parameters simultaneously. Stabilize one variable at a time to observe effects.
