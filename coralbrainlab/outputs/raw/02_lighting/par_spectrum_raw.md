# PAR & Spectrum Fundamentals

## Overview

Light is the primary energy source for a reef ecosystem. Through the biological process of photosynthesis, symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae—which live within coral tissue—convert light energy into chemical energy (sugars and oxygen). This process provides up to 90% of a coral's nutritional requirements. **PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation)** and **Spectrum** are the two fundamental metrics that define whether the light reaching a coral is of sufficient quantity and quality to drive this engine.

Understanding reef photobiology is about more than just "brightness." It is about matching the light source to the specific absorption peaks of the pigments within the coral's tissue. Inadequate light leads to starvation and browning, while excessive light leads to photo-inhibition and bleaching. A successful reef system balances these factors to maximize growth and coloration while staying within the coral’s biological limits.

## Key Concepts

### PAR vs. PUR (Quantity vs. Quality)
*   **PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation):** Measures the total intensity of light between 400nm and 700nm. It tells you how much light is hitting the coral but not which wavelengths are being used. [TIER-1: NOAA / Marine Science]
*   **PUR (Photosynthetically Usable Radiation):** A more precise metric that measures only the wavelengths actually usable by zooxanthellae. A light source can have high PAR but low PUR if it contains too much green or yellow light, which corals do not utilize efficiently. [TIER-2: BRS / Dana Riddle]

### The "Blue Band" and Water Absorption
In nature, water acts as a filter, absorbing red and orange wavelengths within the first few meters. Blue and violet light (400–500nm) penetrate the deepest, which is why most corals have evolved to be highly efficient at absorbing these wavelengths. In an aquarium, utilizing a blue-heavy spectrum mimics the natural environment and stimulates the pigments responsible for both photosynthesis and fluorescent coloration. [TIER-1: AIMS Research]

### Zooxanthellae Pigments
Corals rely on three primary pigments to capture light:
1.  **Chlorophyll a & c2:** The primary drivers of photosynthesis, with absorption peaks in the deep blue (430–465nm) and red (630–665nm) regions.
2.  **Peridinin:** A specialized carotenoid that allows zooxanthellae to capture light in the 470–550nm range (cyan/green), a region where chlorophylls are less effective. This expands the "usability" of the spectrum. [TIER-1: Peer-Reviewed Marine Biology]

### The Calcification Link
Light intensity is directly linked to alkalinity and calcium consumption. Increased light (within safe limits) accelerates the metabolic rate of the zooxanthellae, which in turn increases the rate of coral calcification. This is why lighting changes must always be monitored via chemistry shifts. [TIER-1: Triton Lab Methodology]

## Practical Application

### Measuring with a PAR Meter
Quantitative measurements should be taken at various depths and locations in the tank. PAR levels are highest directly under the lights and drop significantly as you move toward the edges or deeper in the water column.
*   **Scenario:** An SPS coral is showing signs of browning (increased zooxanthellae density). PAR measuring reveals only 150 μmol/m²/s. The coral should be moved to a higher-light area (250–350 PAR) to stimulate pigmented protein production and control algal growth.

### Reading Spectrum Charts
When selecting lighting fixtures, look for "peaks" in the 420–480nm range. A "flat" spectrum with high peaks in the green/yellow (550nm) region is often designed for human visual appeal rather than coral health and may contribute to nuisance algae growth.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Coral Type | Recommended PAR Range (μmol/m²/s) | Rationale |
|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| **SPS (Acropora)** | 250 - 450+ | High energy demand for fast calcification |
| **SPS (Montipora/Birdsnest)** | 200 - 300 | Moderate energy demand |
| **LPS (Euphyllia/Acan)** | 75 - 150 | Lower energy; higher risk of light shock |
| **Soft Corals** | 50 - 100 | Very efficient at low light |
| **Zoanthids** | 100 - 200 | Variable; high tolerance range |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **NEVER** increase PAR by more than 10-15% per week. Sudden increases trigger **photo-inhibition**, where the coral’s photosynthetic machinery "shuts down" to prevent internal damage, often leading to bleaching.
*   **NEVER** target >500 PAR without professional-grade monitoring and ultra-stable water chemistry (specifically consistent alkalinity).

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Light Acclimation:** Always start new corals or new fixtures at 50% intensity or at the bottom of the tank, gradually moving them upward over 4 weeks.
*   **UV Exposure:** Ensure lights have proper UV shielding or are designed to emit "near-UV" (violet) safely. Direct UVC exposure is lethal to coral tissue.

## Interfaces

*   **Depends on:** 01_water_chemistry/stability_parameters (Water clarity/transparency affects penetration).
*   **Informs:** 20_growth_optimization (Energy availability for growth).

## Gaps / Open Questions
*   [GAP] The exact "ideal" ratio of PUR to PAR for different coral species in a captive environment is still debated.
*   [VERIFY] The long-term effects of ultra-blue "monochromatic" lighting versus broad-spectrum "natural" lighting on coral skeletal density.
