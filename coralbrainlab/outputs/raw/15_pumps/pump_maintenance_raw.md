# Pump Maintenance & Calibration

## Overview
The mechanical reliability of aquarium pumps is directly proportional to the consistency of their maintenance. In the high-alkalinity, high-calcium environment of a reef tank, pumps operate in a constant state of chemical attrition. Biologically, the primary goal of maintenance is the **prevention of flow decay**. As calcium carbonate (limescale) accumulates on the impeller and shaft, frictional resistance increases, leading to a gradual reduction in turnover. This "silent" decline can lead to stagnant zones and localized nutrient spikes before the pump eventually seizes. A regular maintenance protocol ensures that the system's "heart" continues to provide the oxygenation and nutrient transport required by sensitive coral species.

From a technical perspective, pump maintenance is about managing **thermal and chemical stress**. The heat generated by the pump's motor block creates a localized zone of low CO2 solubility, which triggers the precipitation of solid calcium carbonate. If left unchecked, this buildup can score the ceramic shaft or cause the impeller magnet to swell and fail. Properly cleaning and inspecting these components every 90-120 days preserves the pump's efficiency and extends its operational life by several years.

## Key Concepts

### The Calcification Cycle in Pumps
- **Localized Precipitation:** The internal surfaces of the pump (impeller/shaft) are often 1-2°C warmer than the surrounding water. This slight temperature increase drives the chemical precipitation of calcium carbonate from the saturated reef water. [TIER-2: BRS]
- **Frictional Wear:** Solid calcium deposits act as an abrasive. As the impeller spins, these crystals "sand down" the ceramic shaft and the internal housing, leading to permanent mechanical noise and efficiency loss. [TIER-1: Engineering Standards]

### Cleaning Chemistry: Citric Acid vs. Vinegar
- **Citric Acid (The Standard):** A superior descaling agent that is odorless and gentle on plastics and elastomers. It effectively dissolves calcium carbonate without the risk of penetrating the impeller housing. [TIER-2: Triton Methodology]
- **Vinegar (The Risk):** Acetic acid can penetrate the plasticized coatings of certain impeller magnets, causing "Impeller Swelling" where the internal iron core oxidizes and expands, eventually seizing the pump. [TIER-2: ReefBuilders]

## Practical Application

### Maintenance Protocol: The 90-Day Deep Clean
1. **Disassemble:** Remove the pump from the system and carefully strip it down to the impeller, shaft, and O-rings.
2. **Soak:** Submerge all non-electronic components in a **Citric Acid solution** (approx. 1 cup per gallon of warm water) for 2-4 hours. [TIER-2: BRS]
3. **Inspect:**
    - **Ceramic Shaft:** Look for scoring, pitting, or hairline fractures. Ceramic is brittle; handle with extreme care.
    - **Impeller Magnet:** Check for any signs of "bloating" or cracks in the plastic coating.
    - **O-Rings:** Inspect for "flattening" or signs of dry rot.
4. **Lubricate:** Apply a thin film of **Food-Grade Silicone Grease** (e.g., Molykote 111) to all O-rings and the ceramic shaft base to ensure a watertight seal and smooth rotation. [TIER-2]
5. **Calibrate (Smart Pumps):** After reassembly, run the pump's "re-calibration" sequence (if available) to ensure the controller accurately detects flow rates and power draw.

### Flow Calibration
- **Stopwatch Test:** For critical return lines, perform a "bucket test" or use an electronic flow meter (like the Neptune FS-100) to verify that the pump is delivering the 10x turnover mandated by the system design. [TIER-2]

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Component | Inspection Frequency | Sign of Failure |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Impeller** | 90 - 120 Days | Scoring, Swelling, Noise |
| **Ceramic Shaft** | 90 - 120 Days | Fractures, Pitting |
| **O-Rings** | Yearly | Flattening, Leaking |
| **Motor Block** | Yearly | Excessive Heat, Vibrations |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Ceramic Fragility:** Never use pliers or excessive force on a ceramic shaft. A micro-fracture will lead to catastrophic failure once the pump returns to 3000+ RPM. [TIER-1]
- **Magnet Damage:** If an impeller magnet shows ANY sign of swelling or the underlying metal is visible, it MUST be replaced immediately. Exposed magnets will leach heavy metals (Iron, Copper, Chrome) directly into the reef water. [TIER-1]

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Citric Priority:** Use Citric Acid over Vinegar for all internal pump cleaning to prevent plasticizer leaching and impeller oxidation. [TIER-2]
- **Spare Parts:** Always maintain a spare impeller and shaft kit locally for the main return pump. [TIER-2]

## Interfaces
- **Connects to:** `15_pumps/return_pumps` (hardware specific)
- **Connects to:** `15_pumps/wavemakers_flow` (vibration and noise issues)
- **Depends on:** `03_water_chemistry/calcium_alkalinity` (defines calcification rate)

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] Quantitative comparison of ceramic vs. stainless steel shaft longevity in high-sand (detritus-heavy) environments.
- [VERIFY] Impact of ultrasonic cleaning vs. chemical soaking for the removal of stubborn inner-motor calcium deposits.
