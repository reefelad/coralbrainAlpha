# SPS Fragging Techniques

## Overview
Small Polyp Stony (SPS) corals, particularly genera like Acropora, Montipora, and Stylophora, are among the most commonly propagated corals in the hobby and commercial aquaculture. This is because their calcium carbonate skeletons provide clean breaking points, and their fast growth rates allow frags to recover and establish quickly.

The biological rationale for successful SPS fragging centers on **minimizing tissue trauma** while ensuring viable polyps remain on the frag. SPS corals allocate significant energy to calcification and growth. A clean cut that follows the natural skeletal grain heals faster because the coral's cellular repair mechanisms have less damaged surface area to regenerate. Conversely, a crushed or jagged cut creates excessive mucus production (a stress response), exposes porous skeleton to algae colonization, and increases the probability of bacterial infection.

## Key Concepts

### Branching vs. Encrusting Morphology
SPS corals exhibit two primary growth forms, and each requires a different fragging approach:

**Branching SPS (Acropora, Stylophora):**
- Cuts are made at the base of side branches or at natural "Y" junctions.
- Bypass bone cutters create a clean shear rather than a crush.
- The "twist-snap" technique: apply light cutter pressure, then twist gently to break along the natural crystalline grain [TIER-2: BRS].

**Encrusting SPS (Montipora capricornis, encrusting Acropora):**
- Fragging requires cutting through a flat, plating structure.
- A band saw (e.g., Gryphon AquaSaw) or tile nippers are more effective than bone cutters.
- Cuts should be made perpendicular to the encrusting surface to create plugs with a flat base for mounting [TIER-2: Reef2Reef].

### Cut Location Strategy
Where you cut matters as much as how you cut:
- **For frags:** Cut near the growth tips (apical meristems) where active calcification and polyp division occur. These sections have the highest regenerative potential.
- **For mother colony:** Leave clean stubs with no exposed tissue; the colony will encrust over clean skeleton.
- **Avoid cutting through the basal encrusting mat:** This tissue anchors the colony and is slow to regenerate.

### Minimum Frag Size
- **Minimum viable:** 1 inch (2.5 cm) with at least one intact growing tip and visible polyps [TIER-2: Consensus].
- **Optimal:** 1.5-2 inches for faster establishment and higher survival during shipping stress.
- Smaller frags are possible but have higher mortality and slower growth.

## Practical Application

### Workflow: Fragging Branching Acropora
1.  **Assess the Colony:** Choose a healthy mother colony with no signs of STN/RTN, good polyp extension, and stable environment for 2+ weeks.
2.  **Select Branches:** Identify 3-5 branches with growing tips. Avoid main structural limbs unless thinning.
3.  **Position Cutters:** Place bone cutter blades at the base of the branch, angled slightly to follow the natural skeleton line.
4.  **Cut & Twist:** Apply firm pressure—do not "nibble." For thick branches, apply pressure to score the skeleton, then twist to snap along the grain.
5.  **Rinse:** Immediately place frags in a container of clean tank water to rinse mucus and debris.
6.  **Dip:** Transfer to a coral dip solution (Revive, Coral RX) for 5-10 minutes to disinfect the wound and deter hitchhikers.
7.  **Mount:** Dry the frag base, apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate gel to a frag plug, and press the frag into place for 15-30 seconds.
8.  **Cure:** Allow glue to cure in air for 1 minute, then place in a low-flow recovery area.

### Workflow: Fragging Encrusting Montipora
1.  **Prepare the Saw:** If using a band saw, fill the reservoir with tank water. Ensure blade is true and clean.
2.  **Remove Colony:** Carefully detach the encrusting colony from its current mount (if necessary).
3.  **Section:** Cut the plate into desired frag sizes, aiming for 1x1 inch squares or larger.
4.  **Rinse & Dip:** As above.
5.  **Mount:** Use a larger frag tile rather than a plug; encrusting corals prefer more surface area.

| Factor | Recommendation | Source |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Minimum frag size | 1 inch (2.5 cm) | [TIER-2: BRS] |
| Optimal frag size | 1.5-2 inches | [TIER-2: Consensus] |
| Recovery flow | Medium (avoid direct jet) | [TIER-2: Reef2Reef] |
| Recovery lighting | 50-70% of mother colony PAR | [TIER-3: Community] |
| Healing time before handling | 2 weeks minimum | [TIER-2: BRS] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Air Exposure:** SPS tissue desiccates rapidly. Limit air exposure to under 30 seconds per frag [TIER-1].
- **Temperature Shock:** Maintain frag container at tank temperature. Do not allow water to cool during a long fragging session.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Lighting Acclimation:** If placing frags in a different lighting zone, acclimate over 1-2 weeks by gradually increasing PAR.
- **Do Not Handle Healing Tissue:** Avoid touching or repositioning frags for at least 2 weeks post-frag.

## Interfaces
- **Connects to:** `12_propagation/healing_protocols` (post-frag care), `12_propagation/fragging_tools` (tool selection).
- **Depends on:** `01_water_chemistry` (stable Alk/Ca for calcification), `02_lighting` (PAR for recovery).
- **Informs:** Growth optimization strategies after establishment.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] Optimal angle of cut for different Acropora skeletal densities.
- [VERIFY] Whether coral dips significantly improve healing outcomes vs. simple rinse.
