## Audit Criteria

### 1. Safety Compliance (TIER 1/2)
- **return_pumps**: TIER 1 Siphon Break mandatory and Non-Metallic water path.
- **wavemakers_flow**: TIER 1 Guarding (Anemone safety) and Magnetic Leaching protection.
- **pump_maintenance**: TIER 1 Ceramic Shaft fragility and Magnet Swelling (heavy metal leaching).
- **photosynthetic_energy**: TIER 1 Acclimation Speed (10%/week) and UV DNA protection.
- **led_fixtures**: TIER 1 Moisture Isolation (Conductive Salt Creep) and Thermal Shutdown.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 2. Discovery First Principles
- **Pumps (15)**: Focuses on "Diffusion Boundary Layer (DBL)" and "Heart" of life support.
- **Lighting Systems (16)**: Explains "Metabolic Engine" and "Biological Ejection Seat" (Bleaching) before hardware specs.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 3. Source Quality & Traceability
- Integration of Triton Lab standards with peer-reviewed biology and BRS experimental data.
- Sources like [TIER-1: NIH Research] and [TIER-1: Engineering ToolBox] provide high-confidence baselines.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 4. Structural Consistency
- All Navigation footers correctly link across domain boundaries (15 -> 16).
- Tables and constraints are prominent and correctly tiered.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

---

## Final Verdict: PASS ✅

**Domains 15 & Start of 16 (Pumps & Lighting) approved for production.**

The transition from hydraulic management into photobiology has been executed with consistent quality and safety adherence.
