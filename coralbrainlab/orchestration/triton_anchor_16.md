## Audit Criteria

### 1. Safety Compliance (TIER 1/2)
- **t5_hybrid**: TIER 1 High Voltage Ignitors and UV-C Mercury Leakage hazards.
- **mounting_solutions**: TIER 1 Drip Loops and Static Load Bearing (3x weight safety factor).
- **cooling_ventilation**: TIER 1 Thermal Lethal Range (20-32°C) and Salinity Drift from evaporation.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 2. Discovery First Principles
- **t5_hybrid**: Explains "Diffuse Refraction" and "Linear Depth Penetration" before lamp types.
- **mounting_solutions**: Explains "Inverse Square Law" and "Spectrum Blending Distance" before hardware arms.
- **cooling_ventilation**: Explains "Latent Heat of Vaporization" and "Saturation Gradients" before fans/chillers.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 3. Source Quality & Traceability
- Consistent application of TIER-1 (Triton, Manufacturer Docs) and TIER-2 (BRS, established experts).
- Conflict resolution applied to Chiller vs. Fan efficiency and Euro-bracing compatibility.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 4. Structural Consistency
- Navigation footers correctly link back to skeleton and forward to next domain (17_filtration_equipment).
- Safety considerations are prominent and use the standardized Tier 1/2 warning system.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅
