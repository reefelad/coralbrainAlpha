# Triton Anchor Audit Report #8

**Date:** 2026-01-28T01:58:00+08:00
**Subdomains Audited:** 53-57
1.  **Fish Quarantine Protocols** (11_acclimation_quarantine)
2.  **Coral Acclimation & Pest Dipping** (11_acclimation_quarantine)
3.  **Acclimation Logistics & Shipping Handling** (11_acclimation_quarantine)
4.  **Vendor Selection & Health Auditing** (11_acclimation_quarantine)
5.  **Coral Quarantine Setup** (11_acclimation_quarantine)

## Audit Results

### 1. Safety Constraint Tiers — COMPLIANT ✅
- All parameter recommendations (Temp, Salinity, Alk) are within TIER 1 absolute limits.
- TIER 2 defaults (Alk change rate, quarantine first) are properly emphasized.
- Warnings for Copper usage in inverted systems and disposal of shipping water are prominent.

### 2. "Stability over Numbers" — APPLIED ✅
- Emphasis on matching the specific baseline of the home system (ICP-verified) rather than chasing theoretical "perfect" numbers.
- Slow acclimation strategies prioritized to prevent metabolic shock.

### 3. "Discovery First" Language — EXCELLENT ✅
- Overviews explain "metabolic debt", "osmotic firewall", and "biological airlock" concepts before technical steps.
- The "why" of shipping stress (anaerobic metabolism, lactic acid) is clearly documented.

### 4. Source Tiering — PROPER ✅
- Consistent use of [TIER-1] for Triton and peer-reviewed research.
- [TIER-2] for expert hobbyist consensus (BRS, Reef2Reef experts).
- All definitive claims are sourced.

### 5. Navigation & structure — COMPLIANT ✅
- Standard domain template applied to all 5 subdomains.
- Navigation footers correctly cross-link the sequence.

### 6. Gaps Documented — COMPLETE ✅
- Identified missing knowledge in microbiome impacts and long-term efficacy of dips.

## Findings
The subdomains in the `Acclimation & Quarantine` domain are of exceptionally high quality. The integration of the "pH/Ammonia Rebound" effect in the logistics section is a particularly strong addition for safety.

## Action Items
- None. System state is healthy.
- Triton Anchor counter reset to 0.
