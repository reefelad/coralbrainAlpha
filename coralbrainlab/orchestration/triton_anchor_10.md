## 1. Safety Compliance Audit

### TIER-1 Constraints Verified:
- ✅ **Flood Prevention** (overflow_mechanics): Sump capacity and check valve warnings correctly prioritized.
- ✅ **Electrical Life-Safety** (electrical_safety): GFCI requirement and wet hands warning correctly mandated.
- ✅ **Chemical Toxicity** (material_selection): Heavy metal prohibition and "The Silicone Rule" explicitly stated.
- ✅ **Potable Materials** (plumbing_hydraulics): NSF-61 requirements and brass/copper prohibition verified.
- ✅ **Electrical Separation** (sump_design): Mounting controllers above splash zones mandated.

### TIER-2 Defaults Verified:
- ✅ Sizing margins for drains (1.5x)
- ✅ Drip loop depth requirements
- ✅ ATO necessity for stability
- ✅ 3D print infill requirements to prevent anaerobic pockets

**Result: PASS** — No TIER-1 violations detected.

## 2. Discovery First Language Audit

All 5 subdomains follow the Discovery First principle:

| Subdomain | WHY Explained Before HOW |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| overflow_mechanics | ✅ Surface renewal and gas exchange physics before plumbing kits |
| sump_design | ✅ Biological zoning (Triton) and nutrient export before glass cutting |
| plumbing_hydraulics | ✅ Fluid dynamics and resistance biology before pipe sizing |
| electrical_safety | ✅ Saltwater conductivity and lethal risk before GFCI specs |
| material_selection | ✅ Chemical noise and accumulation biology before plastic types |

**Result: PASS** — All overviews provide deep biological or physical rationale.

## 3. Source Quality Audit

| Tier | Sources Used | Appropriate |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| TIER-1 | Triton Lab, Randy Holmes-Farley, Engineering ToolBox | ✅ |
| TIER-2 | BRS TV, Ecotech Marine, Simplicity Aquatics | ✅ |
| TIER-3 | Reef2Reef community consensus | ✅ Applied with caution |

**Result: PASS** — Source tiering correctly applied.

## 4. Structural Consistency Audit

All 5 subdomains contain required sections:
- ✅ Overview
- ✅ Key Concepts
- ✅ Practical Application
- ✅ Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables
- ✅ Safety Considerations
- ✅ Interfaces
- ✅ Gaps / Open Questions
- ✅ Sources
- ✅ Navigation

**Result: PASS** — Structural consistency maintained.
