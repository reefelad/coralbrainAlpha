## Audit Criteria

### 1. Safety Compliance (TIER 1/2)
- **skimmer_tuning**: TIER 1 Salinity Drift and Overflow Prevention.
- **fleece_rollers**: TIER 1 Flood Redundancy and GFCI mandates.
- **algae_scrubbers**: TIER 1 Thermal Lethal Range for reactors and Nutrient Bottoming Out.
- **media_reactors**: TIER 1 PO4 Stripping Rate (RTN hazard) and Al99 Exothermic Pre-rinse.
- **uv_sterilizers**: TIER 1 Ocular Safety (Retinal Damage) and Mercury hazards.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 2. Discovery First Principles
- **skimmer_tuning**: Explains "Amphipathic Molecules" and "Surface Adsorption" science.
- **fleece_rollers**: Explains "Nitrogen Loading Prevention" vs legacy socks.
- **algae_scrubbers**: Explains "Competitive Exclusion" and "Biological pH Buffering".
- **media_reactors**: Explains "Chemical Equilibrium" and "Molecular Magnets".
- **uv_sterilizers**: Explains "Pathogen Pressure Management" vs dilution.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 3. Source Quality & Traceability
- Consistent use of Triton Method Manual [TIER-1] for alignment.
- Integrated BRS Investigates [TIER-2] for hardware benchmarks.
- Documented [CONFLICT] points specifically for Triton-style sump sequences vs modern hardware.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

### 4. Structural Consistency
- Navigation footers correctly link back to skeleton and forward to next domain boundary.
- Gaps and Open Questions identify high-value research targets for the model.
- **Verdict**: PASS ✅

---

## Final Verdict: PASS ✅

**Domain 17 (Filtration Equipment) fully completed and approved for production.**

The hardware selection and tuning sections provide a robust bridge between the core filtration science (Domain 07) and practical system operation.
