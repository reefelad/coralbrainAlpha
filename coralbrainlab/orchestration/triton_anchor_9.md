## 1. Safety Compliance Audit

### TIER-1 Constraints Verified:
- ✅ **Palytoxin Hazard** (fragging_tools): Correctly flagged as absolute safety constraint with PPE requirements.
- ✅ **Never Cut Through Tissue** (lps_fragging): Wall Euphyllia prohibition correctly classified as TIER-1.
- ✅ **Terpenoid Toxicity** (soft_coral_fragging): Leather fragging outside display tank correctly mandated.
- ✅ **Parameter Stability** (healing_protocols): Stability during recovery correctly prioritized over optimization.
- ✅ **Air Exposure Limits** (sps_fragging, healing_protocols): 30-second rule consistently applied.

### TIER-2 Defaults Verified:
- ✅ Bleach exposure time limits (fragging_tools)
- ✅ Recovery lighting recommendations (sps_fragging, lps_fragging)
- ✅ Activated carbon post-frag (soft_coral_fragging, healing_protocols)

**Result: PASS** — No TIER-1 violations detected.

## 2. Discovery First Language Audit

All 5 subdomains follow the Discovery First principle:

| Subdomain | WHY Explained Before HOW |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| fragging_tools | ✅ Tissue regeneration biology before tool selection |
| sps_fragging | ✅ Skeletal grain/tissue trauma before technique |
| lps_fragging | ✅ Tissue-to-skeleton ratio before procedure |
| soft_coral_fragging | ✅ Spicule anatomy & terpenoid defense before cutting |
| healing_protocols | ✅ Healing cascade & energy budget before protocols |

**Result: PASS** — All overviews explain biological rationale.

## 3. Source Quality Audit

| Tier | Sources Used | Appropriate |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| TIER-1 | Scientific (Palytoxin), Triton (parameter stability) | ✅ |
| TIER-2 | BRS, Reef2Reef, Reef Builders, Simplicity Aquatics | ✅ |
| TIER-3 | Community consensus (lighting recommendations) | ✅ Applied correctly |

**Result: PASS** — Source tiering correctly applied.

## 4. Structural Consistency Audit

All 5 subdomains contain required sections:
- ✅ Overview
- ✅ Key Concepts
- ✅ Practical Application
- ✅ Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables
- ✅ Safety Considerations
- ✅ Interfaces
- ✅ Gaps / Open Questions
- ✅ Sources
- ✅ Navigation

**Result: PASS** — Structural consistency maintained.
