# Disease Identification (RTN/STN)

## Overview

Corals are complex meta-organisms, forming a "holobiont" where the animal host, endosymbiotic algae (zooxanthellae), and a specialized microbiome exist in a state of high biological efficiency. In a healthy reef system, this biological sanctuary is protected by the coral's immune system and a stable environmental envelope. However, when this balance is disrupted—whether by acute chemical shock, chronic elemental deficiency, or pathogenic invasion—the system can experience a catastrophic failure known as tissue necrosis. 

Tissue necrosis is categorized primarily by its speed of progression: Rapid Tissue Necrosis (RTN) and Slow Tissue Necrosis (STN). These are not diseases in themselves, but rather the terminal phase of biological collapse where the coral's soft tissue loses its adhesion to the calcium carbonate skeleton and sloughs off. In the Triton methodology, preventing necrosis is achieved by maintaining "Stability over Numbers," ensuring that the coral's metabolic pathways (N-DOC) and skeletal-tissue bonds (Trace Elements) remain robust enough to withstand opportunistic pathogens.

## Key Concepts

### Rapid Tissue Necrosis (RTN)
RTN represents an acute systemic failure of the coral holobiont. Characterized by the total loss of tissue within 24 hours, it appears as though the coral is "melting" or "snowing" away, leaving a pristine white skeleton behind. This is typically triggered by extreme environmental shifts that exceed the coral's physiological tipping point, such as temperature spikes or rapid alkalinity increases.

### Slow Tissue Necrosis (STN)
STN is a chronic recession that may persist for weeks or months. It usually begins at the base of the colony (where light and flow are often lowest) and moves upward in a distinct "tide line." STN is frequently a symptom of long-term stress, such as chronic trace element imbalance or poor nutrient ratios (N:P).

### Pathogenic Drivers & The N-DOC Connection
While environmental stress creates the vulnerability, microorganisms are the immediate agents of tissue destruction.
- **Parasites:** Ciliates such as *Philaster lucinda* act as primary pathogens in many RTN cases, actively consuming coral tissue and symbionts.
- **Bacteria:** Opportunistic *Vibrio* species exist naturally in reef systems but can become pathogenic when the coral is stressed.
- **Metabolic Fuel:** High levels of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) can fuel "heterotrophic blooms," where rapid bacterial growth outpaces the coral's immune response. Maintaining proper N-DOC ratios (Carbon:Nitrogen:Phosphorus) ensures that beneficial bacteria are not replaced by pathogenic strains. [TIER-1: Triton/Marine Microbiology]

### The Triton Trace Element Connection
Advanced ICP-OES analysis has revealed critical correlations between specific trace elements and tissue attachment:
- **Bromine (Br):** (Target 60-70 ppm). Bromine contributes to the control of harmful microorganisms and prevents spontaneous tissue detachment. Levels <50 ppm correlate with STN/RTN outbreaks.
- **Barium (Ba):** (Target <100 ppb). Both extreme deficiency and toxicity (>140 ppb) interfere with coral vitality and have been linked to systemic necrosis.
- **Fluorine (F):** (Target 1.0-1.2 ppm). Essential for the calcification process and the structural integrity of the skeleton-tissue bond. [TIER-1: Triton Lab]

## Practical Application

### Visual Diagnosis
- **RTN Identification:** Look for white, "peeled" skeleton where the transition between living tissue and bone is sharp and moving rapidly (visible hour-by-hour).
- **STN Identification:** Look for a slow-moving "recession line." If the exposed skeleton is covered in green or brown biofilm/algae, the recession has likely been occurring for several days or weeks.
- **Brown Jelly Syndrome:** A thick, brown mass over necrotic tissue indicates a secondary infection likely involving *Helicostoma* ciliates. This is highly contagious and requires immediate removal.

### Active Outbreak Protocol
1. **Surgical Intervention:** For localized necrosis, fragging is the most effective save. Use bone cutters or a dedicated coral saw. Bone cutters are often preferred for RTN colonies to avoid the heat and aerosolized "tissue mist" generated by high-speed saws, which can spread pathogens to healthy frags. Cut at least 15-20mm (0.75 inches) into perfectly healthy tissue.
2. **Pathogen Load Reduction:** Dip corals in specialized solutions (e.g., Prime Coral Stop RTN, Lugol’s Iodine) to sanitize the living tissue.
3. **Environment Audit:** Immediately verify Temperature and Alkalinity stability. Check for any mechanical failures (e.g., heater stick, dosing pump failure).
4. **Chemical Analysis:** Perform a Triton ICP test to identify if Trace Element levels (Br, Ba, F) have drifted into the danger zones.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Parameter | Healthy Target | Critical Range (Necrosis Risk) | TIER-1 Safety Limit |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| **Alkalinity** | 7.5 - 8.5 dKH | > 11.0 or < 6.5 dKH | Max Δ 2.0 dKH / day |
| **Temperature** | 24 - 26°C | < 20 or > 30°C | 20°C - 32°C Absolute |

| **Barium** | 10 - 50 ppb | > 140 ppb | N/A (Methodology Limit) |
| **Fluorine** | 1.0 - 1.2 ppm | < 0.8 ppm | N/A (Methodology Limit) |
| **Salinity** | 34 - 35 ppt | < 30 or > 38 ppt | 28 - 40 ppt Absolute |
| **pH** | 8.1 - 8.4 | < 7.8 | 7.5 - 8.8 Absolute |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Alkalinity Stability:** Never change alkalinity by more than 2.0 dKH in 24 hours. Many SPS corals will undergo immediate RTN if "alk-shocked." [VERIFIED]
- **Contaminant Toxicity:** Trace amounts of heavy metals (e.g., Copper from old brass fittings or Tin from glass sealants) can cause systemic necrosis across an entire system. [VERIFIED]

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Bromine Caution:** Do not dose Bromine based on visual signs alone. Overdosing (>90 ppm) is as lethal as deficiency.
- **Nutrient Stripping:** Avoid using massive quantities of fresh GFO or carbon suddenly, as rapid nutrient drops can stress corals into STN.

- [GAP] Variability in "RTN Susceptibility" between different genotypes of the same coral species.
