# Refugium Design & Algae Management

## Overview
In the ocean, coral reefs do not exist in isolation; they are intimately connected to seagrass beds and macroalgae lagoons. These vegetative zones act as the "kidneys" of the ecosystem, absorbing nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) generated by the reef and converting them into plant biomass. Furthermore, these calm, algae-rich environments serve as nurseries for plankton, copepods, and other microfauna that drift back onto the reef to feed corals and fish.

In a closed reef aquarium, a refugium replicates this critical biological link. Unlike a mechanical filter that simply traps waste, a refugium functions as a living metabolic engine. It utilizes photosynthesis to sequester dissolved nutrients that mechanical filtration misses, stabilizes system pH through converting CO2 into oxygen (typically during the night), and creates a continuous supply of live food. The "Triton Method" elevates the refugium from an optional accessory to the **primary** filtration interface, dictating specific flow and volume requirements to ensure the algae bed can outcompete nuisance algae in the display tank for resources.

## Key Concepts

### The 10-20% Ratio
The metabolic capacity of a refugium is directly proportional to its size relative to the bioload.
- **The Concept:** To act as the dominant nutrient sink, the algae filter must be large enough to handle the waste produced by the display.
- **Triton Standard:** The Triton Method explicitly mandates a refugium volume of **10% to 20% of the display tank volume**. This size ensures the algae mass is sufficient to strip nutrients faster than nuisance algae in the display can consume them.

### High Turnover Flow & No Mechanical Filtration
Traditional "old school" refugiums often employed low flow to settle detritus. Modern methodology reverses this completely.
- **The Mechanism:** Algae require rapid delivery of nutrients and carbon dioxide to grow efficiently. Stagnant water limits gas exchange and creates nutrient uptake boundary layers.
- **Application:** Triton specifies running the **entire system turnover (10x per hour)** through the refugium.
- **Critical Design Rule:** Water must enter the refugium **directly** from the overflow. **No mechanical filtration (socks, fleece rollers, floss)** should be placed before the refugium. The algae bed is designed to process "raw" water, trapping particulate matter and feeding the microfauna population found within the algae matrix.

### Reverse Photoperiod
- **pH Stabilization:** Corals and display algae consume CO2 and produce O2 during the day (raising pH), but respire CO2 at night (lowering pH). By lighting the refugium when the display lights are *off* (Reverse Daylight Photosynthesis - RDP), the macroalgae consumes the excess CO2 produced by the display tank, significantly reducing nocturnal pH swings.

## Practical Application

### Macroalgae Selection
- **Chaetomorpha (*Chaetomorpha linum*):** The gold standard. Fast-growing, non-invasive, and forms a dense matrix that is an excellent habitat for pods. It typically does not sporulate ("go sexual") and crash the tank.
- **Caulerpa (*Caulerpa sp.*):** Grows rapidly but carries a **TIER 2 RISK** of sporulation, where the algae releases all its cellular contents into the water, stripping oxygen and releasing toxins. If used, it requires 24/7 lighting or aggressive pruning to prevent this.
- **Biodiversity:** Triton encourages mixing species (e.g., Red Gracilaria, Ulva) to target different nutrient profiles, but *Chaetomorpha* remains the safest backbone.

### Lighting Requirements
- **Spectrum:** Use macroalgae-optimized grow lights. The most efficient spectrum for chlorophyll A and B absorption targets **Deep Red (660nm)** and **Royal Blue (450nm)**. Full spectrum daylight (6500K) is also effective but may be less energy-efficient per watt of growth. Avoid standard "reef" spectrum lights (high blue/actinic/14000K+) as they lack the red intensity needed for rapid green plant growth.
- **Intensity:** High intensity is required to match the high nutrient input. Weak lighting will result in algae die-off and nutrient release.
- **Schedule:** 12-14 hours opposite the display tank.

### Construction & Layout
- **Placement:** In Triton systems, the refugium is typically the **first chamber** after the overflow, before the skimmer. This ensures the algae gets the "rawest" water rich in nutrients.
- **Substrate:** **Bare Bottom** is strongly recommended. Sandbeds in high-flow refugiums can trap detritus and become nutrient sinks.
- **Tumble vs. Static:** Chaetomorpha benefits from "tumbling" (rolling in the current), which exposes all sides to light and prevents inner layers from dying.

### Harvesting Strategy
Nutrient export only occurs when algae is physically removed from the system.
- **Frequency:** Harvest every 2-4 weeks, or when the algae mass fills the chamber.
- **Amount:** Remove 30-50% of the biomass.
- **Technique:** Pull from the older, denser sections (often the bottom if not tumbling), leaving the bright green, actively growing tips. Failing to harvest leads to "crashing" where lower layers die from lack of light/flow, releasing nutrients back into the water.

| **Substrate** | None (Bare Bottom) | Prevents detritus accumulation | `[TIER-1]` |
| **Media** | Chaetomorpha | Primary export mechanism | `[TIER-2]` |

## Safety Considerations
⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **No Guard Fails:** A physical barrier (comb/weir) MUST be in place to prevent algae from floating into the return pump. Shredded algae can clog pumps and rot in the display, causing massive ammonia spikes.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Caulerpa Risk:** Avoid *Caulerpa* species unless you are an advanced user willing to manage sporulation risks. *Chaetomorpha* is the default safe recommendation.
- **Iron Dosing:** Rapidly growing algae consumes Iron. If algae turns yellow/pale, check Iron levels (or dose trace elements) to prevent die-off.
- **Die-off Spirals:** If a large mass of algae dies (turns white/mushy), remove it IMMEDIATELY. Decomposing algae dumps sequestered Nitrate/Phosphate back into the water rapidly.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] **Optimal Light Spectrum:** While horticultural grow lights (Red/Blue) are efficient, some evidence suggests full spectrum (Daylight) produces more robust tissue structure in submerged macroalgae, preventing fragmentation. Definite studies on *Chaetomorpha* specifically are limited.
- [VERIFY] **Triton "First Chamber" Rule:** While Triton recommends Refugium -> Skimmer, some successful systems run Skimmer -> Refugium to keep the refugium cleaner. The impact on pod population survival (skimmate removal) vs. nutrient uptake efficiency needs comparative data in differing system loads.
