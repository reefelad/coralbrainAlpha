# Visual Inspection & Dip (Pest Inspection)

## Overview

Visual Inspection and Chemical Dipping constitute the "Biological Firewall" of a modern reef system. This process is the primary defense against the introduction of devastating pathogens and parasites that can cause systematic failure in an established ecosystem. Biologically, the goal is to break the life cycle of hitchhikers—pests that have evolved to camouflage themselves perfectly within coral tissue or skeletal matrices.

A "Discovery First" perspective recognizes that the aquarium is an artificial concentration of biodiversity. In the wild, pests like Acropora-eating flatworms (AEFW) are kept in check by vast dilution and natural predators. In a closed system, these same organisms experience a population explosion due to the abundance of hosts and lack of natural controls. Dipping is not just a cleaning step; it is a proactive intervention to ensure the "Metabolic Debt" of the coral is not compounded by the energy drain of parasitic predation during the critical recovery phase.

## Key Concepts

### The "White Bowl" Protocol
Pest detection is significantly enhanced by using high-contrast backgrounds. By submerging a coral in a pure white container during the dip, common pests like AEFW (which are translucent/brown) or Red Bugs (tiny red specks) become visible as they are dislodged from the host. This visual feedback is essential for assessing the level of infestation and the effectiveness of the chosen dip. [TIER-2: Melev's Reef / BRS]

### Chemical Disruption (The Dip)
Dips work by overstimulating or paralyzing the nervous systems of invertebrates (pests) without permanently damaging the more robust tissue of the coral host. Different chemicals target different biological pathways:
- **Oxidizers (Iodine):** Disrupt microbial membranes and provide mild antiseptic action to prevent secondary infections at bite sites. [TIER-1: Triton/Scientific Consensus]
- **Nervous System Disruptors (Pine oil/Essential oils):** Utilized in commercial dips (e.g., CoralRx, Revive) to induce a "drop-off" response in flatworms and nudibranchs. [TIER-2]
- **Avermectins/Milbemycin:** Specifically target glutamate-gated chloride channels in crustaceans (Red Bugs/Black Bugs). [TIER-2: Humble.Fish]

### The Egg-Cryptic Phase
It is a critical biological fact that almost no reef-safe chemical dip is effective against the eggs of coral pests. Eggs are protected by a proteinaceous shield that is impervious to standard dipping concentrations. This means that a successful dip removes only the current generation of adults. Eradication requires breaking the life cycle through repeated treatments based on known gestation periods, typically every 5-7 days for 4-6 weeks. [TIER-1: Marine Biology Fundamentals]

### Mechanical Assistance (Basting)
The efficacy of a dip is dependent on mechanical action. High-velocity water movement, provided by a turkey baster or small powerhead, is necessary to physically dislodge pests that are stunned but still clinging to the coral's mucus layer or deep within its skeletal structure. [TIER-2]

## Practical Application

### 1. Step-by-Step Inspection & Dip
- **Step 1: Dry Inspection.** Before wetting, check the base of the coral for clusters of small, circular brown/purple eggs (AEFW or Nudibranch eggs).
- **Step 2: The Dip.** Submerge in the selected solution for 5-15 minutes (following manufacturer guidelines precisely).
- **Step 3: Aggressive Basting.** Use a turkey baster to blast water into all crevices and the underside of the base.
- **Step 4: The Transfer Rinse.** Move the coral to a clean container of system water to rinse off any residual toxins before moving to a quarantine system or final placement.

### 2. Common Pests and Identification
- **AEFW (Acropora Eating Flatworms):** Look for "bite marks" (white circular patches of missing tissue). Adults are roughly 2-3mm and translucent.
- **Red/Black Bugs:** Microscopic mites typically found on smooth-skinned Acropora. Signs include poor polyp extension and loss of color.
- **MEN (Montipora Eating Nudibranchs):** White, branchy sea slugs, usually found on the underside of Montipora. Check for white egg spirals in dead tissue areas.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Dip Type | Concentration (Standard) | Duration | Targeted Pest |
|----------|--------------------------|----------|---------------|
| Iodine-Based | 1-2 ml / L | 10-15 min | Bacteria / Fungal / Mild Pests |
| Commercial (Revive/CoralRx) | Per Label | 5-10 min | Flatworms / Nudis / Bristleworms |
| Off-Label Pesticides (Bayer)* | 10-20 ml / Cup | 5-10 min | Comprehensive (High Risk) |

*\*Note: Use of off-label pesticides like Bayer Advanced is a common hobbyist practice [TIER-3] but carries significantly higher risk to coral tissue and personal safety. Defer to purpose-built reef dips whenever possible.*

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
- **Personal Safety:** Many coral dips (especially concentrated Iodine and agricultural pesticides) are toxic to humans. Always wear gloves and eye protection.
- **Zero Sump Entry:** Never allow dip solution to enter the main aquarium or filtration systems. These chemicals are designed to kill invertebrates and will rapidly crash a reef system's microfauna.

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
- **Sensitivity Testing:** Sensitive corals (Smooth skin Acropora, deepwater species) should be dipped for the minimum recommended time. If "sloughing" (tissue peeling) or excessive bleaching occurs, remove immediately.
- **Base Removal:** When possible, remove the coral from the shipping plug. Plugs are the primary site for egg deposition and are far more difficult to clean than the coral itself. [TIER-2]

## Interfaces
- **Connects to:** [Acclimation Methods](acclimation_methods.md), [Common Pests](../../06_pests_diseases/subdomains/common_pests.md)
- **Depends on:** [Quarantine Setup](coral_quarantine.md) for post-dip observation.
- **Informs:** Integrity of the [Biological Firewall](acclimation_methods.md) and long-term health of the display tank.

## Gaps / Open Questions
- [GAP] Detailed gestation timelines for many emerging pests (e.g., specific polyclad flatworm species) remain unverified in hobbyist literature.
- [VERIFY] The efficacy of "mild" herbal dips against adult AEFW vs. more aggressive oxidizers or neurotoxins.
