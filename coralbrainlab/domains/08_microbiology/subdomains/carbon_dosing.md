# Carbon Dosing (Organic) & Bacterial Populations

## Overview
In the vast oligotrophic (low nutrient) waters of the ocean, the ratio of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus (CNP) available to organisms is remarkably stable. Bacteria, the base of the reef's biological filtration system, require all three of these elements to build biomass and reproduce. In a closed reef aquarium, however, the input of fish food typically creates an abundance of Nitrogen (Nitrates) and Phosphorus (Phosphates), while bio-available Organic Carbon is quickly depleted.

**Carbon Dosing** is the practice of adding a specialized organic carbon source to the water to bridge this gap. By removing Carbon as the "limiting factor," we allow heterotrophic bacteria populations to explode in growth. As these bacteria multiply, they essentially "unlock" and consume the excess Nitrate and Phosphate from the water column to build their cell walls. The resulting bacterial biomass—now loaded with nutrients that were previously dissolved in the water—is then exported via protein skimming or consumed by the coral holobiont. This process transforms dissolved inorganic nutrients (algae fuel) into particulate organic food (coral food), closing the loop in the reef's energy cycle.

## Key Concepts

### The Limiting Factor Principle
Bacterial growth is restricted by the essential nutrient in shortest supply. In most reef tanks without a large refugium, this is organic carbon.
*   **Mechanism:** When Carbon is added, bacteria consume it along with Nitrate and Phosphate in a specific ratio.
*   **Result:** Rapid reduction of NO3 and PO4 levels as they are assimilated into interacting bacterial colonies.
*   **Triton Alignment:** While the Triton Method primarily relies on a large algae refugium for nutrient export, carbon dosing (specifically via *Triton Detox*) is the recommended corrective tool when nutrients exceed natural seawater levels despite the refugium's efforts.

### Bacterial Export vs. Sequestration
It is a common misconception that bacteria simply "eat" the waste and it disappears.
*   **The Reality:** The waste is merely converted from a chemical state (Nitrate/Phosphate) into a biological state (Bacterial Cell).
*   **Export Necessity:** Without a powerful protein skimmer to physically remove these bacteria from the water, the nutrients remain in the system and will be released back into the water column when the bacteria die.
*   **Triton Linkage:** This is why Triton specs emphasize a strong skimmer (rated for the full system volume) alongside any carbon dosing strategy.

### TRITON N:C:P Ratio
Triton research emphasizes the importance of balancing the interactions between Nitrogen, Carbon, and Phosphorus (N-C-P), applying the principles of stoichiometry to aquarium stability.
*   **Balance:** An imbalance in the N:C:P ratio is often the root cause of nuisance organisms.
    *   **High Org-C, Low N/P:** Can lead to Slime Algae/bacterial blooms.
    *   **High N/P, Low C:** Promotes hair algae and inhibits bacterial processing.
    *   **Management:** Dosing is used to manipulate the "C" variable to bring the ratio back into equilibrium, starving out nuisance algae while feeding corals [TIER-1: Triton Ratio Whitepaper].

## Practical Application

### Dosing Sources
1.  **Triton Detox:** A heavy-metal-free organic carbon source specifically formulated to be safe for reef tanks. It minimizes the risk of accumulation that can occur with DIY sources. [TIER-1: Triton Lab]
2.  **DIY Sources (Vodka/Vinegar):** Ethanol (Vodka) and Acetic Acid (Vinegar) are common but carry risks of driving monocultures of specific bacterial strains (e.g., *cyanobacteria* or heavy white slime). [TIER-2: Reefkeeping Magazine]
3.  **Bio-Pellets:** Solid carbon polymers. Less controllable than liquid dosing and not typically part of the core Triton prescription due to the lack of precise control. [TIER-2: BRS Investigates]

### Implementation Strategy
*   **Start Low:** Bacteria respond exponentially. A small dose today can result in a massive bloom tomorrow.
*   **Titrate Up:** Increase dosage slowly (weekly) until Nitrate/Phosphate levels begin to fall, then hold steady.
*   **Skimmer Check:** Ensure the skimmer is producing wet skimmate to export the bacterial mass efficiently.

## Parameter Ranges / Reference Tables

| Parameter | Target Range (Triton) | Interaction | Source |
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------|--------|
| **Nitrate (NO3)** | 2 – 10 ppm | Consumed by bacteria when C is available | [TIER-1] |
| **Phosphate (PO4)** | 0.018 – 0.08 ppm | Consumed by bacteria when C is available | [TIER-1] |
| **Organic Carbon** | Dosed as needed | The "Throttle" for nutrient reduction | [TIER-1] |
| **Skimmer Setting** | Wet / Aggressive | Essential for export of biomass | [TIER-2] |

## Safety Considerations

⚠️ **TIER 1 CONSTRAINTS (Absolute):**
*   **Oxygen Depletion:** Rapid bacterial blooms consume massive amounts of oxygen. **NEVER** initiate high-dose carbon dosing without knowing the system's oxygenation status (ORP) or ensuring heavy aeration. Severe overdoses can asphyxiate fish overnight [TIER-1: Marine Biology Constraints].
*   **No Dosing Without Skimming:** Carbon dosing without a high-efficiency skimmer is dangerous; it creates biomass that simply rots, fouling the water further [TIER-1: Triton Method].

⚠️ **TIER 2 DEFAULTS:**
*   **Bloom Management:** If water becomes cloudy (bacterial bloom), **STOP** dosing immediately and increase surface agitation until clarity returns (typically 24-48 hours).
*   **Cyanobacteria Risk:** Aggressive carbon dosing can sometimes fuel Cyanobacteria if the N:C:P ratio skews too quickly. If Cyano appears, reduce dose by 50%.

## Gaps / Open Questions
*   [GAP] The precise "Triton Ratio" mathematical formula for N:C:P is proprietary; we rely on the principle of balance rather than an exact calculator.
*   [VERIFY] Comparative efficacy of "Triton Detox" vs. generic Carbon sources in preventing monoculture blooms.
